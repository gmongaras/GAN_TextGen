1. We are born and we die. No one cares, no one remembers, and it doesn't matter. This is why we laugh.

4. If you can't eat it, wear it, wield it, or carry it, leave it behind.

Man, I see in fight club the strongest and smartest men who've ever lived. I see all this potential, and I see squandering.

We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual war...our Great Depression is our lives.

If you are reading this then this warning is for you.
 Every word you read of this useless fine print is another second off your life. Don't you have other things to do? Is your life so empty that you honestly can't think of a better way to spend these moments? Or are you so impressed with authority that you give respect and credence to all that claim it? Do you read everything you're supposed to read? Do you think every thing you're supposed to think? Buy what you're told to want? Get out of your apartment. Meet a member of the opposite sex.

Everything we know is only some kind of approximation.
Stay committed in your decisions, but stay flexible in your approach.
I don't know what's the matter with people: they don't learn by understanding, they learn by some other way -- by rote or something. Their knowledge is so fragile!
Some people say, 'How can you live without knowing?' I do not know what they mean. I always live without knowing. That is easy. How you get to know is what I want to know.

Good actions give strength to ourselves and inspire good actions in others.
Nothing is so strong as gentleness. Nothing is so gentle as real strength.
The real man smiles in trouble, gathers strength from distress, and grows brave by reflection.
Once you choose hope, anything's possible.
Were it not for hope the heart would break.
Hope begins in the dark, the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: you don't give up.
No winter lasts forever; no spring skips it's turn.
Open your heart -- open it wide; someone is standing outside.

Occasionally in life there are those moments of unutterable fulfillment which cannot be completely explained by those symbols called words. Their meanings can only be articulated by the inaudible language of the heart.
We are all in the same boat in a stormy sea, and we owe each other a terrible loyalty.
The best things in life are never rationed. Friendship, loyalty, love, do not require coupons.
It is better to be faithful than famous.
The test of courage comes when we are in the minority. The test of tolerance comes when we are in the majority.
To sit patiently with a yearning that has not yet been fulfilled, and to trust that, that fulfillment will come, is quite possibly one of the most powerful "magic skills" that human beings are capable of. It has been noted by almost every ancient wisdom tradition.
Life has meaning only if one barters it day by day for something other than itself.
No one is more cherished in this world than someone who lightens the burden of another.
I can live for two months on a good compliment.
It should be your care, therefore, and mine, to elevate the minds of our children and exalt their courage; to accelerate and animate their industry and activity; to excite in them an habitual contempt of meanness, abhorrence of injustice and inhumanity, and an ambition to excel in every capacity, faculty, and virtue.
When you begin to touch your heart or let your heart be touched, you begin to discover that it's bottomless, that it doesn't have any resolution, that this heart is huge, vast, and limitless. You begin to discover how much warmth and gentleness is there, as well as how much space.
No one's head aches when he is comforting another.
The value of compassion cannot be over-emphasized. Anyone can criticize. It takes a true believer to be compassionate. No greater burden can be borne by an individual than to know no one cares or understands.
Compassion is sometimes the fatal capacity for feeling what it is like to live inside somebody else's skin. It is the knowledge that there can never really be any peace and joy for me until there is peace and joy finally for you too.
Consult not your fears but your hopes and your dreams. Think not about your frustrations, but about your unfulfilled potential. Concern yourself not with what you tried and failed in, but with what it is still possible for you to do.
Life is full of beauty. Notice it. Notice the bumble bee, the small child, and the smiling faces. Smell the rain, and feel the wind. Live your life to the fullest potential, and fight for your dreams.
Appreciation...acknowledges the presence of good wherever you shine the light of your thankful thoughts.
The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.
The most basic of all human needs is the need to understand and be understood. The best way to understand people is to listen to them.
Be a good listener. Your ears will never get you in trouble.
To accomplish great things, we must not only act, but also dream; not only plan, but also believe.
Dreams come in a size too big so that we may grow into them.
And the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom.
If one dream should fall and break into a thousand pieces, never be afraid to pick one of those pieces up and begin again.
Gracefulness has been defined to be the outward expression of the inward harmony of the soul.
Within sorrow is grace. When we come close to those things that break us down, we touch those things that also break us open. And in that breaking open, we uncover our true nature.
When you have a sense of your own identity and a vision of where you want to go in your life, you then have the basis for reaching out to the world and going after your dreams for a better life.
What ever beauty may be, it has for its basis order, and for its essence unity.
A mind is a fire to be kindled, not a vessel to be filled.
To be good is noble, but to teach others how to be good is nobler--and less trouble.
Take control of your destiny. Believe in yourself. Ignore those who try to discourage you. Avoid negative sources, people, places, things and habits. Don't give up and don't give in.
When spider webs unite they can tie up a lion.
The average person puts only 25% of his energy into his work.
 The world takes off its hat to those who put in more than 50% of their capacity, and stands on its head for those few and far between souls who devote 100%.
Therefore hold to the things which are reliable. Look to simplicity; embrace purity; Lessen the self; diminish desire.
My belief is that personal freedom cannot grow beyond personal responsibility. The more people that learn to be fully accountable for their lives, the more freedom each of us can enjoy and the more fulfilling all of our lives will be.
The need for devotion to something outside ourselves is even more profound than the need for companionship. If we are not to go to pieces or wither away, we must have some purpose in life; for no man can live for himself alone.
Above all be of single aim; have a legitimate and useful purpose, and devote yourself unreservedly to it.
Whatever I have tried to do in life, I have tried with all my heart to do it well; whatever I have devoted myself to, I have devoted myself completely; in great aims and in small I have always thoroughly been in earnest.
We learn more by looking for the answer to a question and not finding it than we do from learning the answer itself.
Tell me and I'll forget; show me and I may remember; involve me and I'll understand.
I am a part of all that I have met.
Only a life lived for others is worth living.
Only he can understand what a farm is, what a country is, who shall have sacrificed part of himself to his farm or country, fought to save it, struggled to make it beautiful. Only then will the love of farm or country fill his heart.
The wise man belongs to all countries, for the home of a great soul is the whole world.
Diversity is the one true thing we all have in common. Celebrate it every day.
As man draws nearer to the stars, why should he not also draw nearer to his neighbor?
Infinitely more important than sharing one's material wealth is sharing the wealth of ourselves, our time and energy, our passion and commitment, and, above all, our love.
By sharing something, I realized that I'm not alone, that there are a lot of people that share with me the same preoccupations, the same ideas, the same ideals, and the same quest for a meaning for this life.
It's not enough to have lived. We should be determined to live for something. May I suggest that it be creating joy for others, sharing what we have for the betterment of personkind, bringing hope to the lost and love to the lonely.
There is something more -- the spirit, or the soul. I think that that quality encourages our courtesy and care and our minds. And mercy, and identity.
I place a high moral value on the way people behave. I find it repellent to have a lot, and to behave with anything other than courtesy in the old sense of the word -- politeness of the heart, a gentleness of the spirit.
Character is the total of thousands of small daily strivings to live up to the best that is in us.
With courage you will dare to take risks, have the strength to be compassionate, and the wisdom to be humble. Courage is the foundation of integrity.
Courage is almost a contradiction in terms: it means a strong desire to live taking the form of readiness to die.
Keep your dreams alive. Understand to achieve anything requires faith and belief in yourself, vision, hard work, determination, and dedication. Remember all things are possible for those who believe.
Life means to have something definite to do, a mission to fulfilled and in the measure in which we avoid setting our life to something, we make it empty. Human life, by its very nature, has to be dedicated to something.
Dedicate some of your life to others. Your dedication will not be a sacrifice. It will be an exhilarating experience because it is an intense effort applied toward a meaningful end.
Love yourself, accept yourself, forgive yourself, and be good to yourself, because without you the rest of us are without a source of many wonderful things.
To love means loving the unlovable. To forgive means pardoning the unpardonable. Faith means believing the unbelievable. Hope means hoping when everything seems hopeless.
When work, commitment, and pleasure all become one and you reach that deep well where passion lives, nothing is impossible.
When you get in a tight place and everything goes against you, till it seems as though you could not hold on a minute longer, never give up then, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn.
It was character that got us out of bed, commitment that moved us into action, and discipline that enabled us to follow through.
Reach high, for stars lie hidden in your soul. Dream deep, for every dream precedes the goal.
The road of life twists and turns and no two directions are ever the same. Yet our lessons come from the journey, not the destination.
You are here for a purpose. There is no duplicate of you in the whole wide world. There never has been, there never will be. You were brought here now to fill a certain need. Take time to think that over.
Humility leads to strength and not to weakness. It is the highest form of self-respect to admit mistakes and to make amends for them.
Sense shines with a double luster when it is set in humility. An able and yet humble man is a jewel worth a kingdom.
Dream your dream. Follow your heart. Imagine. Listen to the wind. Drink sunsets. Be free. Let the wonder never cease. Believe. Wish on EVERY star. Create adventure. Be Kind.
The best thing to give to your enemy is forgiveness; to an opponent, tolerance; to a friend, your heart; to your child, a good example; to a father, deference; to your mother, conduct that will make her proud of you; to yourself, respect; to all men, charity.
Respect is love in plain clothes.
Respect your fellow human being, treat them fairly, disagree with them honestly, enjoy their friendship, explore your thoughts about one another candidly, work together for a common goal and help one another achieve it.
When your values are clear to you, making decisions becomes easier.
The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don't play together, the club won't be worth a dime.
Every great dream begins with a dreamer. Always remember, you have within you the strength, the patience, and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world.
The keys to patience are acceptance and faith. Accept things as they are, and look realistically at the world around you. Have faith in yourself and in the direction you have chosen.
People are like stained-glass windows. They sparkle and shine when the sun is out, but when the darkness sets in their true beauty is revealed only if there is light from within.
Confidence, like art, never comes from having all the answers; it comes from being open to all the questions.
Confidence...thrives on honesty, on honor, on the sacredness of obligations, on faithful protection and on unselfish performance. Without them it cannot live.
Laugh at yourself, but don't ever aim your doubt at yourself. Be bold. When you embark for strange places, don't leave any of yourself safely on shore. Have the nerve to go into unexplored territory.
Kindness in words creates confidence. Kindness in thinking creates profoundness. Kindness in giving creates love.
Hold yourself responsible for a higher standard than anybody else expects of you, never excuse yourself.
If you take responsibility for yourself you will develop a hunger to accomplish your dreams.
You can turn painful situations around through laughter. If you can find humor in anything, even poverty, you can survive it.
A kind heart is a fountain of gladness, making everything in its vicinity freshen into smiles.
Our character...is an omen of our destiny, and the more integrity we have and keep, the simpler and nobler that destiny is likely to be.
Have the courage to say no. Have the courage to face the truth. Do the right thing because it is right. These are the magic keys to living your life with integrity.
Integrity is not a conditional word. It doesn't blow in the wind or change with the weather. It is your inner image of yourself, and if you look in there and see a man who won't cheat, then you know he never will.
Parents, teach your children to express themselves. Teach them to be in touch with their emotions, to speak honestly to people, and to maintain integrity and stick by their principles in all they do. This is perhaps the highest morality you can instill.
Don't wait for extraordinary opportunities. Seize common occasions and make them great. Weak men wait for opportunities; strong men make them.
There will always be a frontier where there is an open mind and a willing hand.
A great attitude does much more than turn on the lights in our worlds; it seems to magically connect us to all sorts of serendipitous opportunities that were somehow absent before the change.
Live life fully while you're here. Experience everything. Take care of yourself and your friends. Have fun, be crazy, be weird. Go out and screw up! You're going to anyway, so you might as well enjoy the process. Take the opportunity to learn from your mistakes: find the cause of your problem and eliminate it. Don't try to be perfect; just be an excellent example of being human.
Start where you are. Distant fields always look greener, but opportunity lies right where you are. Take advantage of every opportunity of service.
Challenges are what make life interesting; overcoming them is what makes life meaningful.
The most authentic thing about us is our capacity to create, to overcome, to endure, to transform, to love and to be greater than our suffering.
The harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly; it is dearness only that gives everything its value. I love the man that can smile in trouble, that can gather strength from distress and grow brave by reflection.
Be willing to have it so. Acceptance of what has happened is the first step to overcoming the consequences of any misfortune.
If we study the lives of great men and women carefully and unemotionally we find that, invariably, greatness was developed, tested and revealed through the darker periods of their lives. One of the largest tributaries of the River of Greatness is always the Stream of Adversity.
It doesn't matter who you are, where you come from. The ability to triumph begins with you. Always.
I do believe that when we face challenges in life that are far beyond our own power, it's an opportunity to build on our faith, inner strength, and courage. I've learned that how we face challenges plays a big role in the outcome of them.
Greatness lies, not in being strong, but in the right using of strength; and strength is not used rightly when it serves only to carry a man above his fellows for his own solitary glory. He is the greatest whose strength carries up the most hearts by the attraction of his own.
Hope is the dream of a soul awake.
When the world says, 'Give up,' hope whispers, 'Try it one more time.'
Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; but remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for.
We are all functioning at a small fraction of our capacity to live life fully in its total meaning of loving, caring, creating, and adventuring. Consequently, the actualizing of our potential can become the most exciting adventure of our lifetime.
You have the need and the right to spend part of your life caring for your soul. It is not easy...To be a soulful person means to go against all the pervasive, prove-yourself values of our culture and instead treasure what is unique and internal and valuable in yourself and your own personal evolution.
Extend to each person, no matter how trivial the contact, all the care and kindness and understanding and love that you can muster, and do it with no thought of any reward. Your life will never be the same again.
Do not wait; the time will never be 'just right'. Start where you stand, and work with whatever tools you may have at your command, and better tools will be found as you go along.
Put your heart, mind, intellect and soul even to your smallest acts. This is the secret of success.
Some people grumble because roses have thorns; I am thankful that the thorns have roses.
Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all the others.
Gratitude bestows reverence, allowing us to encounter everyday epiphanies, those transcendent moments of awe that change forever how we experience life and the world.
Each friend represents a world in us, a world possibly not born until they arrive, and it is only by this meeting that a new world is born.
You have been my friend. That in itself is a tremendous thing... By helping you, perhaps I was trying to lift up my life a trifle. Heaven knows anyone's life can stand a little of that.
I believe that friends are quiet angels who sit on our shoulders and lift our wings when we forget how to fly.
Friendship doubles our joy and divides our grief.
The most important key to achieving great success is to decide upon your goal and launch, get started, take action, move.
Ambition is the path to success. Persistence is the vehicle you arrive in.
A man without ambition is dead. A man with ambition but no love is dead. A man with ambition and love for his blessings here on earth is ever so alive.
We must have a theme, a goal, a purpose in our lives. If you don't know where you're aiming, you don't have a goal. My goal is to live my life in such a way that when I die, someone can say, she cared.
To do something, however small, to make others happier and better, is the highest ambition, the most elevating hope, which can inspire a human being.
No more duty can be urged upon those who are entering the great theater of life than simple loyalty to their best convictions.
Goals. There's not telling what you can do when you get inspired by them. There's no telling what you can do when you believe in them. There's no telling what will happen when you act upon them.
If I have been of service, if I have glimpsed more of the nature and essence of ultimate good, if I am inspired to reach wider horizons of thought and action, if I am at peace with myself, it has been a successful day.
A smile is the beginning of peace.
This is the way of peace: Overcome evil with good, falsehood with truth, and hatred with love.
We shall find peace. We shall hear angels. We shall see the sky sparkling with diamonds.
Peace is not something you wish for; It's something you make, Something you do, Something you are, And something you give away.
Trust yourself. Create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life. Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.
Follow your heart, but be quiet for a while first. Ask questions, then feel the answer. Learn to trust your heart.
Remember, there are no mistakes, only lessons. Love yourself, trust your choices, and everything is possible.
Trust in what you love, continue to do it, and it will take you where you need to go.
Dare to be true: nothing can need a lie: A fault, which needs it most, grows two thereby.
A person is not given integrity. It results from the relentless pursuit of honesty at all times.
Honesty is the first chapter in the book of wisdom.
Don't worry so much about your self- esteem. Worry more about your character. Integrity is its own reward.
Compassion is the desire that moves the individual self to widen the scope of its self-concern to embrace the whole of the universal self.
Giving connects two people, the giver and the receiver, and this connection gives birth to a new sense of belonging.
Compassion is the ultimate and most meaningful embodiment of emotional maturity. It is through compassion that a person achieves the highest peak and deepest reach in his or her search for self-fulfillment.
If you realized how powerful your thoughts are, you would never think a negative thought.
A word of encouragement during a failure is worth more than an hour of praise after success.
One of the sanest, surest, and most generous joys of life comes from being happy over the good fortune of others.
Make it a habit to tell people thank you. To express your appreciation, sincerely and without the expectation of anything in return. Truly appreciate those around you, and you'll soon find many others around you. Truly appreciate life, and you'll find that you have more of it.
Let me not hurt, by any selfish deed, Or thoughtless word, the heart of foe or friend; Nor would I pass, unseeing, worthy need, Or sin by silence when I should defend... 'The world is better that I lived to-day.'
We must not, in trying to think about how we can make a big difference, ignore the small daily differences we can make which, over time, add up to big differences that we often cannot foresee.
Your vocation in life is where your greatest joy meets the world's greatest need.
Each day when I awake I know I have one more day to make a difference in someone's life.
Listening is such a simple act. It requires us to be present, and that takes practice, but we don't have to do anything else. We don't have to advise, or coach, or sound wise. We just have to be willing to sit there and listen.
Wisdom is the reward you get for a lifetime of listening when you'd have preferred to talk.
Listening is an attitude of the heart, a genuine desire to be with another which both attracts and heals.
The greatest compliment that was ever paid me was when one asked me what I thought, and attended to my answer.
I remind myself every morning: Nothing I say this day will teach me anything. So if I'm going to learn, I must do it by listening.
Set out each day believing in your dreams. Know without a doubt that you were made for amazing things.
The work goes on, the cause endures, the hope still lives and the dreams shall never die.
One isn't necessarily born with courage, but one is born with potential. Without courage, we cannot practice any other virtue with consistency. We can't be kind, true, merciful, generous, or honest.
There is a wonderful mythical law of nature that the three things we crave most in life-happiness, freedom, and peace of mind-are always attained by giving them to someone else.
Champions aren't made in gyms. Champions are made from something they have deep inside them -- a desire, a dream, a vision. They have to have the skill, and the will. But the will must be stronger than the skill.
There is no teaching to compare with example.
There's only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving, and that's your own self.
Love is an expression and assertion of self-esteem, a response to one's own values in the person of another.
Believe in your dreams and they may come true; believe in yourself and they will come true.
The soul gives unity to what it looks at with love.
Cooperation is the thorough conviction that nobody can get there unless everybody gets there.
There can only be one state of mind as you approach any profound test; total concentration, a spirit of togetherness, and strength.
One man may hit the mark, another blunder; but heed not these distinctions. Only from the alliance of the one, working with and through the other, are great things born.
There are no problems we cannot solve together, and very few that we can solve by ourselves.
Never tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do and they will surprise you with their ingenuity.
The creative is the place where no one else has ever been. You have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. What you'll discover will be wonderful. What you'll discover is yourself.
The world is but a canvas to the imagination.
The moment when you first wake up in the morning is the most wonderful of the twenty-four hours. No matter how weary or dreary you may feel, you possess the certainty that, during the day that lies before you, absolutely anything may happen. And the fact that it practically always doesn't, matters not a jot. The possibility is always there.
Friends are helpful not only because they will listen to us, but because they will laugh at us; Through them we learn a little objectivity, a little modesty, a little courtesy; We learn the rules of life and become better players of the game.
Get over the idea that only children should spend their time in study. Be a student so long as you still have something to learn, and this will mean all your life.
Learn everything you can, anytime you can, from anyone you can -- there will always come a time when you will be grateful you did.
I believe that the rendering of useful service is the common duty of mankind and that only in the purifying fire of sacrifice is the dross of selfishness consumed and the greatness of the human soul set free.
It is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge.
We have all known the long loneliness and we have learned that the only solution is love and that love comes with community.
Excellence is to do a common thing in an uncommon way.
All the art of living lies in a fine mingling of letting go and holding on.
Because life is a living, breathing work of art, you are a painting as you go. Be a masterpiece. Drink in life. Laugh too loud. Compliment others constantly.
Beauty is an experience, nothing else. It is not a fixed pattern or an arrangement of features. It is something felt, a glow or a communicated sense of fineness.
A true hero is not someone who thinks about doing what is right, but one that simply does what is right without thinking!
Passively listening to gossip or negative talk is implied agreement.
Patience -- the gift of being able to see past the emotion.
Class never runs scared. It is sure-footed and confident, and it can handle whatever comes along. Class has a sense of humor. It knows that a good laugh is the best lubricant for oiling the machinery of human relations. Class never makes excuses. It takes its lumps and learns from mistakes. Class knows that good manners are nothing more than a series of small sacrifices and minor inconveniences. Class bespeaks an aristocracy unrelated to ancestors or money. Some extremely wealthy people have no class at all, while others who are struggling to make ends meet are loaded with it. Class is real. You can't fake it. Class is comfortable in its own skin. It never puts on airs. Class never tries to build itself up by tearing others down. Class is already up and need not attempt to look better by making others look worse. Class can walk with kings and keep its virtue and talk with crowds and keep the common touch. Everyone is comfortable with the person who has class because he is comfortable with himself. If you have class, you've got it made. If you don't have class, no matter what else you have, it won't make up for it.
Peace at home, peace in the world.
A life full of enthusiasm, hope and contributions through one's own talent is a life well lived.
One value that was sewn into the stitching of our character at a very early age had to do with our responsibility to help others....We were expected to be of assistance to our neighbors... 'Being neighborly'... was synonymous with being kind, friendly, and helpful to our neighbors and something that we were encouraged to do on a regular basis through firsthand experience. It was a bit like mandatory community service.
We were taught to respect everyone, especially those who were older and wiser than we were from whom we could learn.
Having to apply and try out for something forces kids to take the time to think about and make decisions on what they feel is worth their time and effort. It winds up being a great foreshadower and introduction of the reality of dealing with the competitiveness of life...The focus, practice, and determination that this process requires are preparation for life's challenges and teach lessons on facing disappointment during the times when someone does not make the team.
You are a master of the words you don't say and a slave to the ones you do.
Anticipation is the key to success.
I want to live long enough see the day the people in this world put aside their differences and work hand in hand to achieve that state of acceptance of themselves and their surroundings, also known as PEACE.
No matter how much you plan, it is tenacity, unyielding desire to succeed, and the ability to cope with change that will eventually prevail.
If you are content with the best you have done, you will never become the best you can be.
Self-trust is the first secret of success, the belief that if you are here the authorities of the universe put you here, and for cause, or with some task strictly appointed you in your constitution, and so long as you work at that you are well and successful.
In all affairs it's a healthy thing now and then to hang a question mark on the things you have long taken for granted.
I've learned from experience that the greater part of our happiness or misery depends on our dispositions and not on our circumstances.
Class never runs scared. It is sure-footed and confident, and it can handle whatever comes along. Class has a sense of humor. It knows that a good laugh is the best lubricant for oiling the machinery of human relations. Class never makes excuses. It takes its lumps and learns from mistakes...Class is comfortable in its own skin. It never puts on airs. Class never tries to build itself up by tearing others down. If you have class, you've got it made.
Let us tenderly and kindly cherish, therefore, the means of knowledge. Let us dare to read, think, speak, and write.
An invasion of armies can be resisted, but not an idea whose time has come.
You cannot escape the results of your thoughts. Whatever your present environment may be, you will fall, remain or rise with your thoughts, your vision, your ideal. You will become as small as your controlling desire; as great as your dominant aspiration.
You've got to have a dream, if you want to have a dream come true.
He is rich who is content with the least; for contentment is the wealth of nature.
When I started counting my blessings, my whole life turned around.
Anyone can carry his burden, however hard, until nightfall. Anyone can do his work, however hard, for one day. Anyone can live sweetly, patiently, lovingly, purely, till the sun goes down. And this is all life really means.
Your purpose may not always be obvious, but always remember that you do have a purpose.
I've always thought that a big laugh is a really loud noise from the soul saying, 'Ain't that the truth.'
When you have once seen the glow of happiness on the face of a beloved person, you know that a man can have no vocation but to awaken that light on [all] the faces surrounding him.
Every heart that has beat strong and cheerfully has left a hopeful impulse behind it in the world, and bettered the tradition of mankind.
Where hope grows, miracles blossom.
No act of kindness is too small. The gift of kindness may start as a small ripple that over time can turn into a tidal wave affecting the lives of many.
A good friend is a connection to life, a tie to the past, a road to the future, the key to sanity in a totally insane world.
There is one thing one has to have: either a soul that is cheerful by nature, or a soul made cheerful by work, love, art, and knowledge.
Being rich of heart makes you wealthy beyond compare.
The best part of life is not just surviving, but thriving with passion and compassion and humor and style and generosity and kindness.
Think left and think right and think low and think high. Oh, the thinks you can think up if only you try!
Our success as a nation is not measured by how many years we have governed or how many wars we have won. It is measured by the quality of life which we have created for the society that our ideals were founded upon.
He who has faith has... an inward reservoir of courage, hope, confidence, calmness, and assuring trust that all will come out well -- even though to the world it may appear to come out most badly.
A sense of humor... is needed armor. Joy in one's heart and some laughter on one's lips is a sign that the person down deep has a pretty good grasp of life.
You don't have to accept the invitation to get angry. Instead, practice forgiveness, empathy and encouragement.
Blessed is the season which engages the whole world in a conspiracy of love.
We are each gifted in a unique and important way. It is our privilege and our adventure to discover our own special light.
There is neither happiness nor unhappiness in this world; there is merely the comparison of one state to the other. Only a man who has felt ultimate despair is capable of feeling ultimate bliss.
Every day you have the opportunity to learn and experience some-thing and some-one new. Seize the opportunity. Learn and experience everything you can, and use it to change the world.
There is no beautifier of complexion, or form, or behavior, like the wish to scatter joy and not pain around us. 'Tis good to give a stranger a meal, or a night's lodging. 'Tis better to be hospitable to his good meaning and thought, and give courage to a companion. We must be as courteous to a man as we are to a picture, which we are willing to give the advantage of a good light.
Love is patient, Love is Kind, it does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.
Participate joyfully in the sorrows of the world. We cannot cure the world of sorrows, but we can choose to live in joy.
You're alive. Do something. The directive in life, the moral imperative was so uncomplicated. It could be expressed in single words, not complete sentences. It sounded like this: Look. Listen. Choose. Act.
I appreciate people who are civil, whether they mean it or not. I think: Be civil. Do not cherish your opinion over my feelings. There's a vanity to candor that isn't really worth it. Be kind.
The key to immortality is first living a life worth remembering.
You have only always to do what is right. It will become easier by practice, and you enjoy in the midst of your trials the pleasure of an approving conscience.
The first step to getting the things you want out of life is this: Decide what you want.
What is defeat? Nothing but education; nothing but the first step to something better.
When there is no where else to turn, turn inward. Enter into the sacred silence of your soul and ask for healing, guidance and personal peace.
Our soul desires to be understanding, our ego is only concerned with being understood. When you are being understanding you are connected to your soul.
Love is friendship that has caught fire. It is quiet understanding, mutual confidence, sharing and forgiving. It is loyalty through good and bad times. It settles for less than perfection and makes allowances for human weaknesses.
Courage is not the absence of fear, but rather the judgment that something else is more important than fear.
Trials, temptations, disappointments -- all these are helps instead of hindrances, if one uses them rightly. They not only test the fiber of character but strengthen it...Every trial endured and weathered in the right spirit makes a soul nobler and stronger than it was before.
Call it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe, call it a family. Whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one.
A true friend freely, advises justly, assists readily, adventures boldly, takes all patiently, defends courageously, and continues a friend unchangeably.
A leader is someone who demonstrates what's possible.
After all these years, I am still involved in the process of self-discovery. It's better to explore life and make mistakes than to play it safe. Mistakes are part of the dues one pays for a full life.
Society is joint action and cooperation in which each participant sees the other partner's success as a means for the attainment of his own.
Despair shows us the limit of our imagination. Imaginations shared create collaboration, and collaboration creates community, and community inspires social change.

Wherever there is a human in need, there is an opportunity for kindness and to make a difference.
Don't waste life in doubts and fears; spend yourself on the work before you, well assured that the right performance of this hour's duties will be the best preparation for the hours and ages that will follow it.
Peace holds within itself trust in the Lord, the trust that He governs all things and provides all things, and that He leads towards an end that is good.
Life is just a chance to grow a soul.
I like living. I have sometimes been wildly, despairingly, acutely miserable, racked with sorrow, but through it all I still know quite certainly that just to be alive is a grand thing.
Love life and life will love you back. Love people and they will love you back.
Nobody in life gets exactly what they thought they were going to get. But if you work really hard and you're kind, amazing things will happen.
Failing to prepare is like preparing to fail.
Life is short and we have never too much time for gladdening the hearts of those who are traveling the dark journey with us. Oh be swift to love, make haste to be kind.
Your living is determined not so much by what life brings to you as by the attitude you bring to life; not so much by what happens to you as by the way your mind looks at what happens.
Rejoice in the things that are present; all else is beyond thee.
Every now and again take a good look at something not made with hands: a mountain, a star, the turn of a stream. There will come to you wisdom and patience and solace and, above all, the assurance that you are not alone in the world.
A man knows he has found his vocation when he stops thinking about how to live, and begins to live.
A person who doubts himself is like a man who would enlist in the ranks of his enemies and bear arms against himself. He makes his failure certain by himself being the first person to be convinced of it.
All human wisdom is summed up in two words; wait and hope.

Don't be afraid to be amazing.
The giving of love is an education in itself.
Never talk defeat. Use words like hope, belief, faith, victory.
Judge me not by physical size or appearance, but judge me by the size of my character.
A pessimist is one who makes difficulties of his opportunities and an optimist is one who makes opportunities of his difficulties.
Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine as children do. It's not just in some of us; it is in everyone. And as we let our own lights shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.
It always seems impossible until its done.
The time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time.
You know you're in love when you don't want to fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams.
When you are kind to someone in trouble, you hope they'll remember and be kind to someone else. And it'll become like a wildfire.
Love is always bestowed as a gift -- freely, willingly, and without expectation. We don't love to be loved; we love to love.
Breathe. Let go. And remind yourself that this very moment is the only one you know you have for sure.
Four Very Powerful Words to Say to Your Child: I BELIEVE IN YOU.
Dig within. Within is the wellspring of Good; and it is always ready to bubble up, if you just dig.
Kindness is an inner desire that makes us want to do good things even if we do not get anything in return. It is the joy of our life to do them. When we do good things from this inner desire, there is kindness in everything we think, say, want and do.
When you do nothing, you feel overwhelmed and powerless. But when you get involved, you feel the sense of hope and accomplishment that comes from knowing you are working to make things better.
Life is less about what you do, and more about how and why you do those things. This is called character.
We tend to forget that happiness doesn't come as a result of getting something we don't have, but rather of recognizing and appreciating what we do have.
When what we want to do and what we ought to do are two different things, character is built in the choice we make.
What first we find impossible, we later deem unlikely, and eventually accept as inevitable.
What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life -- to be with each other in silent unspeakable memories.
Let the beauty that we love be what we do.
It's highly virtuous to say we'll be good, but we can't do it all at once, and it takes a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull all together before some of us even get our feet set in the right way.
If your dream requires patience, give it.
Be careful of your actions. You never know when your creating a memory.
What should young people do with their lives today? Many things, obviously. But the most daring thing is to create stable communities in which the terrible disease of loneliness can be cured.
We can never get a re-creation of community and heal our society without giving our citizens a sense of belonging.
Among the things you can give and still keep are your word, a smile, and a grateful heart.
Know in your heart that all things are possible. We couldn't conceive of a miracle if none had ever happened.
I don't measure a man's success by how high he climbs but how high he bounces when he hits bottom.
If you don't stand for something, you will fall for anything.
When your brook dries up and disappointment comes your way, you do not necessarily need to assume that you did something wrong.
Stop thinking gratitude as a buy product of your circumstances and start thinking of it as a world view.
Live today. Not yesterday. Not tomorrow. Just today. Inhabit your moments. Don't rent them out to tomorrow.
When obstacles arise, you change your direction to reach your goal, you do not change your decision to get there.
I guess I can't really change the past since it's now history and I certainly cannot change tomorrow, for I am not promised it, but I can change the way I live today. This realization in itself is the root of not only who I want to be tomorrow, but who I am working on being today. Never again do I want to fail anything without an attempt; I want push myself to my fullest potential, and if that means that I fall a few times along the way then so be it, but I will no longer allow myself to just give up. I deserve better, and it is time that I start believing that.
He who wishes to secure the good of others, has already secured his own.
The longer I live, the more I realize the impact of attitude on life.
Dare to reach out your hand into the darkness, to pull another hand into the light.
Do not let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do.
Love never reasons but profusely gives; gives, like a thoughtless prodigal, its all, and trembles lest it has done too little.
Hope is not pretending that troubles don't exist. It is the hope that they won't last forever. That hurts will be healed and difficulties overcome. That we will be led out of the darkness and into the sunshine.
It ain't about how hard you can hit. Its about how hard you can get hit, and how much you can take, and keep moving forward.
Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination, full of hope.
Who will tell whether one happy moment of love or the joy of breathing or walking on a bright morning and smelling the fresh air, is not worth all the suffering and effort which life implies.
I count life just a stuff, to try the soul's strength on.
Hold fast to dreams. For if dreams die, life is a broken-winged bird that cannot fly.
Friendship, love, health, energy, enthusiasm, and joy are the things that make life worth living and exploring.
Walk with the dreamers, the believers, the courageous, the cheerful, the planners, the doers, the successful people with their heads in the clouds and their feet on the ground. Let their spirit ignite a fire within you to leave this world better than when you found it.
Things turn out best for the people who make the best of the way things turn out.
There comes a time in your life when you have to let go of all the pointless drama and the people who create it and surround yourself with people who make you laugh so hard that you forget the bad and focus solely on the good. After all, life is too short to be anything but happy.
Do not count the days; make the days count.
We do not remember days; we remember moments.
Enjoy the little things, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things.
And in the end it's not the years in your life that count; it's the life in your years.
There's only us, there's only this. Forget regret, or life is yours to miss. No other road, no other way, no day but today.
Fruit does not grow on the trunk...it is found out on the limb.
Each day offers us the gift of being a special occasion if we can simply learn that as well as giving, it is blessed to receive with grace and a grateful heart.
Remember the things in life that are free to each of us-our family, our friends, our soul, our hopes, our dreams, and our knowledge-are the most important.
When we serve we experience, when we experience we teach, when we teach we learn, when we learn our lives are permanently changed, and as our lives are changed we are enriched beyond our wildest dreams.
Some come and leave, fulfilling a single purpose; others, for a time or a season to teach us by sharing their experiences; and last, a select few who participate forever with relationships that endure through eternity.
Spring ushers in the birth and growth of new beginnings. Summer develops and matures new life in the warmth of light. Fall celebrates life and displays inspiration through color. Winter then rests and builds for the new day, preparing for the next season.
Motivation is knowing you are learning, growing, and succeeding toward your desired outcome while sustaining positive momentum.
To live a life fulfilled reflect on the things you have with gratitude.
Make the decision, make it with confidence, and the world will be yours.
Success is nothing more or less than being who you want to be; progressing toward your ideal each day.
At the end of your life, you will never regret not having passed one more test, not winning one more verdict, or not closing one more deal. You will regret time not spent with a husband, a friend, a child, or a parent.
What I've experienced is that I can't know the future. I can't know if anything that I do will change what happens tomorrow. I can't know with certainty, but what I do know is if I do nothing, nothing will change.
Live your life from your heart. Share from your heart. And your story will touch and heal people's souls.
People, even more than things, have to be restored, renewed, revived, reclaimed, and redeemed; never throw out anyone.
In the hour of adversity, be not without hope; for crystal rain falls from black clouds.
Humankind has not woven the web of life. We are but one thread within it. Whatever we do to the web, we do to ourselves. All things are bound together. All things connect.
Climb the mountains and get their good tidings. Nature's peace will flow into you as sunshine flows into trees. The winds will blow their own freshness into you, and the storms their energy, while cares will drop off like autumn leaves.
Nothing is a waste of time if you use the experience wisely.
There is a destiny that makes us brothers, No one goes his way alone; All that we send into the lives of others, Comes back into our own.
There is no problem unless we choose to make it one, so think carefully before you act.
You are Braver than you Believe, Smarter than you Seem, and Stronger than you Think.
Tomorrow do thy worst, I have lived today.
The vision that you glorify in your mind, the ideal that you enthrone in your heart -- this you will build your life by, and this you will become.
To meet at all, one must open ones eyes to another; and there is no true conversation no matter how many words are spoken, unless the eye, unveiled and listening, opens itself to the other.
Courage is about doing what you're afraid to do. There can be no courage unless you're scared.
Thoughts lead on to purposes; purposes go forth in action; actions form habits; habits decide character; and character fixes our destiny.
It is the nature of the strong heart, that like the palm tree it strives ever upwards when it is most burdened.
When we talk about understanding, surely it takes place only when the mind listens completely -- the mind being your heart, your nerves, your ears- when you give your whole attention to it.
Nature, by example, shows us anything worthwhile comes over time. Anything worthwhile grows methodically, building on a strong foundation. Develop a willingness to carry on despite roadblocks.
Maintain composure in times of heightened emotion, reacting only when thoughts are calm and clear. Being sensible will open doors for solutions and creativity.
Sometimes the most important thing in a whole day is the rest we take between two deep breaths.
There are two big forces at work, external and internal. We have very little control over external forces such as tornadoes, earthquakes, floods, disasters, illness and pain. What really matters is the internal force. How do I respond to those disasters? Over that I have complete control.
Behold the turtle. He only makes progress when he sticks his neck out.
A mistake is a crash-course in learning.
Genius is nothing but a great capacity for patience.
The art of being yourself at your best is the art of unfolding your personality into the person you want to be...Be gentle with yourself, learn to love yourself, to forgive yourself, for only as we have the right attitude toward ourselves can we have the right attitude toward others.
Remember there's no such thing as a small act of kindness. Every act creates a ripple with no logical end.
There is no passion to be found playing small -- in settling for a life that is less than the one you are capable of living.
There is only one way to happiness and that is to cease worrying about things which are beyond the power of our will.
Most of our obstacles would melt away if, instead of cowering before them, we should make up our minds to walk boldly through them.
If a man does not know what port he is steering for, no wind is favorable to him.
Smile at each other, smile at your wife, smile at your husband, smile at your children, smile at each other -- it doesn't matter who it is -- and that will help you to grow up in greater love for each other.
Today you are You, that is truer than true. There is no one alive who is Youer than You.
Many small people, in many small places, do many small things, that can alter the face of the world.

The happiest people I have known have been those who gave themselves no concern about their own souls, but did their uttermost to mitigate the miseries of others.
Look for the good and praise it.
It is lack of love for ourselves that inhibits our compassion toward others. If we make friends with ourselves, then there is no obstacle to opening our hearts and minds to others.
You can't stay in your corner of the forest waiting for others to come to you. You have to go to them sometimes.
Courage is only the accumulation of small steps.
If you laugh -- you change; and when you change -- the world changes.
If the world seems cold to you, kindle fires to warm it.
Helping, fixing and serving represent three different ways of seeing life. When you help, you see life as weak. When you fix, you see life as broken. When you serve, you see life as whole. Fixing and helping may be the work of the ego, and service the work of the soul.
To live for results would be to sentence myself to continuous frustration. My only sure reward is in my actions and not from them.
To keep our faces toward change and behave like free spirits in the presence of fate is strength undefeatable.
Happiness comes of the capacity to feel deeply, to enjoy simply, to think freely, to risk life, to be needed.
Encouragement is the oxygen of the soul.
Do more than belong: participate. Do more than care: help. Do more than believe: practice. Do more than be fair: be kind. Do more than forgive: forget. Do more than dream: work.
A smile is the universal welcome.
Joy is prayer - Joy is strength - Joy is love - Joy is a net of love by which you can catch souls. She gives most who gives with Joy.

The turning point in the process of growing up is when you discover the core of strength within you that survives all hurt.
To bear defeat with dignity, to accept criticism with poise, to receive honors with humility -- these are marks of maturity and graciousness.
Self-acceptance comes from meeting life's challenges vigorously. Don't numb yourself to your trials and difficulties, nor build mental walls to exclude pain from your life. You will find peace not by trying to escape your problems, but by confronting them courageously. You will find peace not in denial, but in victory.
Always fall in with what you're asked to accept. Take what is given, and make it over your way. My aim in life has always been to hold my own with whatever's going. Not against: with.
The creative person is willing to live with ambiguity. He doesn't need problems solved immediately and can afford to wait for the right ideas.
Everyone has a story, make your own worth telling.
We cannot tell the precise moment when friendship formed. As in filling a vessel drop by drop, there is at last a drop which makes it run over; so in a series of kindness there is at last one which makes the heart run over.
You are only as strong as your purpose, therefore let us choose reasons to act that are big, bold, righteous and eternal.
It's okay to look back at the past. Just don't stare.
Creativity doesn't wait for that perfect moment. It fashions its own perfect moments out of ordinary ones.
The happy heart runs with the river, floats on the air, lifts to the music, soars with the eagle, hopes with the prayer.
Every day you may make progress. Every step may be fruitful. Yet there will stretch out before you an ever-lengthening, ever ascending, ever-improving path. You know you will never get to the end of the journey. But this, so far from discouraging, only adds to the joy and glory of the climb.
It's not that I'm so smart, it's just that I stay with problems longer.
Experience is a hard teacher because she gives the test first, the lesson afterwards.
Today, more than ever before, life must be characterized by a sense of Universal responsibility, not only nation to nation and human to human, but also human to other forms of life.
What is success? I think it is a mixture of having a flair for the thing that you are doing; knowing that it is not enough, that you have got to have hard work and a certain sense of purpose.
Courage is like love; it must have hope for nourishment.
Freedom has its life in the hearts, the actions, the spirit of men and so it must be daily earned and refreshed -- else like a flower cut from its life-giving roots, it will wither and die.
I love the man that can smile in trouble, that can gather strength from distress, and grow brave by reflection. 'Tis the business of little minds to shrink, but he whose heart is firm, and whose conscience approves his conduct, will pursue his principles unto death.
I have seen what a laugh can do. It can transform almost unbearable tears into something bearable, even hopeful.
As the builders say, the larger stones do not lie well without the lesser.

If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart.
You can gain more friends by being yourself than you can by putting up a front. You can gain more friends by building people up than you can by tearing them down. And you can gain more friends by taking a few minutes from each day to do something kind for someone, whether it be a friend or a complete stranger. What a difference one person can make!
Everybody can be great. Because anybody can serve. You don't have to have a college degree to serve. You don't have to make your subject and your verb agree to serve.... You don't have to know the second theory of thermodynamics in physics to serve. You only need a heart full of grace. A soul generated by love.
We plant seeds that will flower as results in our lives, so best to remove the weeds of anger, avarice, envy and doubt, that peace and abundance may manifest for all.
The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function. One should, for example, be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise.
Do the one thing you think you cannot do. Fail at it. Try again. Do better the second time. The only people who never tumble are those who never mount the high wire. This is your moment. Own it.
Every thought is a seed. If you plant crab apples, don't count on harvesting Golden Delicious.
For a long time it had seemed to me that life was about to begin -- real life. But there was always some obstacle in the way, something to be gotten through first, some unfinished business, time still to be served, a debt to be paid. Then life would begin. At last it dawned on me that these obstacles were my life.
With every experience, you alone are painting your own canvas, thought by thought, choice by choice.
Let me tell you the secret that has led me to my goals: my strength lies solely in my tenacity.

My riches consist not in the extent of my possessions, but in the fewness of my wants.
If we do not lay ourselves at the service of mankind, whom should we serve?
A man may fight fiercely to hold his own in business; but he does not need to fight to get ahead of someone in the elevator, or up the car steps, or at the post office window. And no matter how strong competition is, business and personal courtesy make it easier and pleasanter for everybody.
Changing the world is good for those who want their names in books. But being happy, that is for those who write their names in the lives of others, and hold the hearts of others as the treasure most dear.
There will come a time when you believe everything is finished. That will be the beginning.
Do you wish to rise? Begin by descending. You plan a tower that will pierce the clouds? Lay first the foundation of humility.
It takes generosity to discover the whole through others. If you realize you are only a violin, you can open yourself up to the world by playing your role in the concert.
Wisdom and penetration are the fruit of experience, not the lessons of retirement and leisure. Great necessities call out great virtues.

Unless commitment is made, there are only promises and hopes... but no plans.
Every calling is great when greatly pursued.
Example has more followers than reason. We unconsciously imitate what pleases us, and insensibly approximate to the characters we most admire. In this way, a generous habit of thought and of action carries with it an incalculable influence.
To be rich in admiration and free from envy, to rejoice greatly in the good of others, to love with such generosity of heart that your love is still a dear possession in absence or unkindness -- these are the gifts which money cannot buy.
Your attitude is your altitude. It determines how high you fly.
Sometimes when learning comes before experience it doesn't make sense right away.
The best way to predict the future is to create it.
Man's mind stretched to a new idea never goes back to its original dimensions.
To be honest, to be kind -- to earn a little and to spend a little less, to make upon the whole a family happier for his presence, to renounce when that shall be necessary and not be embittered, to keep a few friends, but these without capitulation -- above all, on the same grim condition, to keep friends with himself -- here is a task for all that a man has of fortitude and delicacy.
It is not because things are difficult that we do not dare; it is because we do not dare that they are difficult.
The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other's life.
Wherever we are, it is our friends that make our world.

God's promises are like the stars; the darker the night the brighter they shine.
Respect for intellectual excellence, the restoration of vigor and discipline to our ideas of study, curricula which aim at strengthening intellectual fiber and stretching the power of young minds, personal commitment and responsibility-these are the preconditions of educational recovery in America today; and, I believe, they have always been the preconditions of happiness and sanity for the human race.

If a man be gracious and courteous to strangers, it shows he is a citizen of the world, and that his heart is no island cut off from other lands, but a continent that joins to them.
When your views on the world and your intellect are being challenged and you begin to feel uncomfortable because of a contradiction you've detected that is threatening your current model of the world...pay attention. You are about to learn something.
We must continually remind students in the classroom that expression of different opinions and dissenting ideas affirms the intellectual process. We should forcefully explain that our role is not to teach them to think as we do but rather to teach them, by example, the importance of taking a stance that is rooted in rigorous engagement with the full range of ideas about a topic.

It takes both rain and sunshine to make a rainbow.
Surely the day will come when color means nothing more than skin tone, when religion is seen uniquely as a way to speak one's soul; when birth places have the weight of a throw of the dice and all men are born free, when understanding breeds love and brotherhood.
Moderation is the feebleness and sloth of the soul, whereas ambition is the warmth and activity of it.
The world is moving so fast these days that the man who says it can't be done is generally interrupted by someone doing it.
Shared joys make a friend, not shared sufferings.

I would rather be able to appreciate things I can not have than to have things I am not able to appreciate.
Love is blind; friendship closes its eyes.
... life is moral responsibility. Life is several other things, we do not deny. It is beauty, it is joy, it is tragedy, it is comedy, it is psychical and physical pleasure, it is the interplay of a thousand rude or delicate motions and emotions, it is the grimmest and the merriest motley of phantasmagoria that could appeal to the gravest or the maddest brush ever put to palette; but it is steadily and sturdily and always moral responsibility.
Treat the other man's faith gently; it is all he has to believe with.
Children have never been very good at listening to their elders, but they have never failed to imitate them.

Nothing is more contagious than example, and no man does any exceeding good or exceeding ill but it spawns new deeds of the same kind. The good we imitate through emulation, the ill through the malignity of our nature, which shame keeps locked up, but example sets free.
If you work for a man, in heaven's name work for him! If he pays you wages that supply you your bread and butter, work for him -- speak well of him, think well of him, stand by him and stand by the institution he represents. I think if I worked for a man I would work for him. I would not work for him a part of the time, and the rest of the time work against him. I would give an undivided service or none. If put to the pinch, an ounce of loyalty is worth a pound of cleverness.

Neither fire nor wind, birth nor death can erase our good deeds.

Happiness can be found in even the darkest of times, but only to those who remember to turn on the light.

Find the sick, the suffering, and the lonely right there where you are -- in your own homes and in your own families, in your workplaces and in your schools.

Have faith.' We can decide to risk that He is indeed there, watching, caring, cherishing us as we love and accept love. The world will be a better place for it.

My humanity is bound up in yours, for we can only be human together.
An imagination is a powerful tool. It can tint memories of the past, shade perceptions of the present, or paint a future so vivid that it can entice...or terrify, all depending upon how we conduct ourselves today.

A man may die, nations may rise and fall, but an idea lives on.
Don't let slip an opportunity; it may never come again.
Be careful what you water your dreams with. Water them with worry and fear and you will produce weeds that choke the life from your dream. Water them with optimism and solutions and you will cultivate success.
Difference is of the essence of humanity. Difference is an accident of birth and it should therefore never be the source of hatred or conflict. The answer to difference is to respect it. Therein lies a most fundamental principle of peace: respect for diversity.
Obstinacy in a bad cause is but constancy in a good.
Leadership and learning are indispensable to each other.
Fall seven times, stand up eight.
At bottom every man knows well enough that he is a unique being, only once on this earth; and by no extraordinary chance will such a marvelously picturesque piece of diversity in unity as he is, ever be put together a second time.
In the confrontation between the stream and the rock, the stream always wins -- not through strength but by perseverance.
Belief consists in accepting the affirmations of the soul; unbelief, in denying them.
It is from numberless diverse acts of courage and belief that human history is shaped. Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring, those ripples build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.
With time and patience the mulberry leaf becomes a silk gown.
Loyalty and devotion lead to bravery. Bravery leads to the spirit of self-sacrifice. The spirit of self-sacrifice creates trust in the power of love.
[People] may be said to resemble not the bricks of which a house is built, but the pieces of a picture puzzle, each differing in shape, but matching the rest, and thus bringing out the picture.
Rough diamonds may sometimes be mistaken for worthless pebbles.
The future does not belong to those who are content with today, apathetic toward common problems and their fellow man alike, timid and fearful in the face of bold projects and new ideas. Rather, it will belong to those who can blend passion, reason and courage in a personal commitment to [their] ideals.
A handfull of patience is worth a bushel of brains.
You are as young as your faith, as old as your doubt; as young as your self-confidence, as old as your fear, as young as your hope, as old as your despair.
We have become not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic. Different people, different beliefs, different yearnings, different hopes, different dreams.
...the day will come when man will recognize woman as his peer, not only at the fireside but in the councils of the nation. Then, and not until then, will there be the perfect comradeship, the ideal union, between the sexes that shall result in the highest development of the race.
Always do what you are afraid to do.
There are those who look at things the way they are, and ask why... I dream of things that never were, and ask why not?
Lack of patience in small matters can create havoc in great ones.
Cancer can take away all of my physical abilities. It cannot touch my mind, it cannot touch my heart, and it cannot touch my soul. And those three things are going to carry on forever.

Most people never run far enough on their first wind to find out they've got a second. Give your dreams all you've got and you'll be amazed at the energy that comes out of you.
In a mood of faith and hope my work goes on. A ream of fresh paper lies on my desk waiting for the next book. I am a writer and I take up my pen to write.
Man was born rich, or inevitably grows rich by the use of his faculties; by the union of thought with nature.
If we cannot now end our differences, at least we can help made the world safe for diversity.
Patience: To wait with certainity; the art of allowing life to carry you.
Happiness is inward, and not outward; and so, it does not depend on what we have, but on what we are.
No horse gets anywhere until he is harnessed. No stream or gas drives anything until it is confined. No Niagara is ever turned into light and power until it is tunneled. No life ever grows great until it is focused, dedicated, disciplined.
To serve is beautiful, but only if it is done with joy and a whole heart and a free mind.
The highest vocation we can have is Love. Love in action is service.
The unity of freedom has never relied on uniformity of opinion.
One may go a long way after one is tired.
What would life be if we had no courage to attempt anything?
Listening to someone talk isn't at all like listening to their words played over on a machine. What you hear when you have a face before you is never what you hear when you have before you a winding tape.
The wave of the future is not the conquest of the world by a single dogmatic creed but the liberation of the diverse energies of free nations and free men.
The man who removes a mountain begins by carrying away small stones.
Great things are not done by impulse, but by a series of small things brought together.
Hard work spotlights the character of people: some turn up their sleeves, some turn up their noses, and some don't turn up at all.

When a person is down in the world, an ounce of help is better than a pound of preaching.
I believe that man will not merely endure: he will prevail. He is immortal, not because he alone among creatures has an inexhaustible voice, but because he has a soul, a spirit capable of compassion and sacrifice and endurance.
Prepare the umbrella before it rains.
Friends broaden our horizons. They serve as new models with whom we can identify. They allow us to be ourselves--and accept us that way. They enhance our self-esteem because they think we're okay, because we matter to them. And because they matter to us-for various reasons, at various levels of intensity-they enrich the quality of our emotional life.
Sincere forgiveness isn't colored with expectations that the other person apologize or change. Don't worry whether or not they finally understand you. Love them and release them. Life feeds back truth to people in its own way and time
A good heart is better than all the heads in the world.
We all need to know what it means to be honest. Honesty is more than not lying. It is truth telling, truth speaking, truth living, and truth loving.
He who wants a rose must respect the thorn.
Arise, awake, and stop not until the goal is achieved.
Without forgiveness, there's no future.
You have a clean slate every day you wake up. You have a chance every single morning to make that change and be the person you want to be. You just have to decide to do it. Decide today's the day. Say it; This is going to be my day.
Success seems to be largely a matter of hanging on after others let go.
We must develop and maintain the capacity to forgive. He who is devoid of the power to forgive is devoid of the power to love. There is some good in the worst of us and some evil in the best of us.
If you want to be respected, you must respect yourself.
Success flourishes only in perseverance--ceaseless, restless perseverance.

I fear no one, but I respect everyone.
Forgiveness is not an occasional act: it is an attitude.
The young should be treated with respect.
The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.
There is no end. There is no beginning. There is only the infinite passion of life.
One may be old in years, but not in spirit, or poor in wealth, but not in ambition.
Where there is life, there is hope. Where there are hopes, there are dreams. Where there are vivid dreams repeated, they become goals. Goals become the action plans and game plans that winners dwell on in intricate detail, knowing that achievement is almost automatic when the goal becomes an inner commitment. The response to the challenges of life-purpose-is the healing balm that enables each of us to face up to adversity and strife.
The most beautiful discovery true friends make is that they can grow separately without growing apart.
When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall, one by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle.
Set your expectations high; find men and women whose integrity and values you respect; get their agreement on a course of action; and give them your ultimate trust.
If a man is called to be a streetsweeper, he should sweep streets even as Michelangelo painted, or Beethoven played music, or Shakespeare wrote poetry. He should sweep streets so well that all the hosts of heaven and earth will pause to say, here lived a great streetsweeper who did his job well.
Man has responsibility, not power.
The reason most people never reach their goals is that they don't define them, learn about them, or even seriously consider them as believable or achievable.
When we honestly ask ourselves which person in our lives means the most us, we often find that it is those who, instead of giving much advice, solutions, or cures, have chosen rather to share our pain and touch our wounds with a gentle and tender hand. The friend who can be silent with us in a moment of despair or confusion, who can stay with us in an hour of grief and bereavement, who can tolerate not knowing, not curing, not healing and face with us the reality of our powerlessness, that is a friend who cares.
Only I can change my life. No one can do it for me.
The words of kindness are more healing to a drooping heart than balm or honey.
Life's most urgent question is: What are you doing for others?
By learning you will teach, by teaching you will learn.

If a child is to keep alive his inborn sense of wonder, he needs the companionship of at least one adult who can share it, rediscovering with him the joy, excitement and mystery of the world we live in.
Dare to be honest and fear no labor.
Action is character.
Hatred paralyzes life; love releases it. Hatred confuses life; love harmonizes it. Hatred darkens life; love illumines it.
When two are of one mind, their strength can cut gold.
To carry a grudge is like being stung to death by one bee.
What is a friend? A single soul dwelling in two bodies.
Vitality shows in not only the ability to persist but the ability to start over.

It is an equal failing to trust everybody, and to trust nobody.
Courtesy is the one coin you can never have too much of or be stingy with.
Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word, a listening ear, an honest compliment, or the smallest act of caring, all of which have the potential to turn a life around.
One must always hope when one is desperate, and doubt when one hopes.
Unity is power.
Greatness is not found in possessions, power, position, or prestige. It is discovered in goodness, humility, service, and character.
The hardest arithmetic to master is that which enables us to count our blessings.
Change is the end result of all true learning. Change involves three things: First, a dissatisfaction with self -- a felt void or need; second, a decision to change to fill the void or need; and third, a conscious dedication to the process of growth and change -- the willful act of making the change, doing something.
Most of us, swimming against the tides of trouble the world knows nothing about, need only a bit of praise or encouragement -- and we will make the goal.

By the work one knows the workman.
Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.

Any man's life will be filled with constant and unexpected encouragement if he makes up his mind to do his level best each day.
Gratitude is the fairest blossom which springs from the soul.

Patience and time do more than strength or passion.
Our children need our presence, not our presents.
The deepest craving of human nature is the need to be appreciated.
Giving frees us from the familiar territory of our own needs by opening our mind to the unexplained worlds occupied by the needs of others.
It is the small doubts of timid souls that accomplish their ruin. It is the narrow vision, the fear and trembling hesitation, that constitute defeat.
Ideas are only lethal if you suppress and don't discuss them. Ignorance is not bliss, it's stupid. Banning books shows you don't trust your kids to think and you don't trust yourself to be able to talk to them.
I hope I shall possess firmness and virtue enough to maintain what I consider the most enviable of all titles, the character of an honest man.
God gave you a gift of 86,400 seconds today. Have you used one to say 'thank you?'
Forgiveness is man's deepest need and highest achievement.
Despising cowardice in others, I wished to prove myself no coward.

And in striving to provide a living for them, I found a success beyond my wildest dreams.
We must learn to live together as brothers or perish together as fools.

Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.
Gratitude is the memory of the heart.
The question "Who am I?" is not a philosophical football meant to be kicked around coffeehouses by pseudo-intellectuals. It's a real-life question. Nothing is more important and more relevant than to know who you are.
Much of the success of life depends upon keeping one's mind open to opportunity and seizing it when it comes.
Our loyalties must transcend our race, our tribe, our class, and our nation; and this means we must develop a world perspective.
Those who can adapt to change are those who will continue to grow.
Not what we say about our blessings, but how we use them, is the true measure of our thanksgiving.
Optimism is the foundation of courage.
You can easily judge the character of others by how they treat those who can do nothing for them or to them.
A blessed thing it is for any man or woman to have a friend, one human soul whom we can trust utterly, who knows the best and worst of us, and who loves us in spite of all our faults.
Achievement of your happiness is the only moral purpose of your life, and that happiness, not pain or mindless self-indulgence, is the proof of your moral integrity, since it is the proof and the result of your loyalty to the achievement of your values.
Character is doing the right thing when nobody's looking. There are too many people who think that the only thing that's right is to get by, and the only thing that's wrong is to get caught.
Gratitude is happiness double by wonder.
I have spread my dreams under your feet; Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.
Diamonds are nothing more than chunks of coal that stuck to their jobs.
The very least you can do in your life is to figure out what you hope for. And the most you can do is live inside that hope.
The question isn't who is going to let me; it's who is going to stop me.
The wise person understands that his own happiness must include the happiness of others.
A man is not idle because he is absorbed in thought. There is a visible labor and there is an invisible labor.
The longer I live, the more I am certain that the great difference between the great and the insignificant, is energy-invincible determination-a purpose once fixed, and then death or victory.
There is joy in work. There is no happiness except in the realization that we have accomplished something.
I always prefer to believe the best of everybody-it saves so much trouble.
From the smallest necessity to the highest religious abstraction, from the wheel to the skyscraper, everything we are and everything we have comes from one attribute of man -- the function of his reasoning mind.
The love of our neighbor in all its fullness simply means being able to say, What are you going through?
I don't wait for moods. You accomplish nothing if you do that. Your mind must know it has got to get down to work.
Life is a series of experiences, each one of which makes us bigger, even though it is hard to realize this. For the world was built to develop character, and we must learn that the setbacks and griefs which we endure help us in our marching onward.
I will speak to a youth which can accomplish everything, precisely because it accepts no past, obeys no present, and fears no future.
The purpose of morality is to teach you, not to suffer and die, but to enjoy yourself and live.
If you can't excel with talent, triumph with effort.
Never work just for money or for power. They won't save your soul or help you sleep at night.
Great opportunities to help others seldom come, but small ones surround us every day.
In the name of the best within you, do not sacrifice this world to those who are its worst. In the name of the values that keep you alive, do not let your vision of man be distorted by the ugly, the cowardly, the mindless... Do not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark, in the hopeless swamps of the approximate, the not-quite, the not-yet, the not-at-all. Do not let the hero in your soul perish, in lonely frustration for the life you deserved, but have never been able to reach. Check your road and the nature of your battle. The world you desired can be won, it exists, it is real, it is possible, it's yours.
Money matters, but less than we think and not in the way we think. Family is important. So are friends. Envy is toxic. So is excessive thinking. Beaches are optional. Trust is not. Neither is gratitude.

In the depths of winter I finally learned there was in me an invincible summer.
One of the greatest discoveries a man makes, one of his great surprises, is to find he can do what he was afraid he couldn't do.
The moment of truth, the sudden emergence of a new insight, is an act of intuition. Such intuitions give the appearance of miraculous flushes, or short-circuits of reasoning. In fact they may be likened to an immersed chain, of which only the beginning and the end are visible above the surface of consciousness. The diver vanishes at one end of the chain and comes up at the other end, guided by invisible links.
When you have established that one alternative is good and the other is evil, there is no justification for the choice of a mixture. There is no justification ever for choosing any part of what you know to be evil.
Our happiness is completely and utterly intertwined with other people: family, friends, neighbors and the woman who you hardly notice who cleans your office.
Imagine what a harmonious world it could be if every single person, both young and old, shared a little of what he is good at doing.
Integrity has no need of rules.
Nobody can think straight who does not work. Idleness warps the mind.
Some people think only intellect counts: knowing how to solve problems, knowing how to get by, knowing how to identify an advantage and seize it. But the functions of intellect are insufficient without courage, love, friendship, compassion and empathy.
They had that special grace, that special spirit that says, Give me a challenge and I'll meet it with joy.
Long before I wrote stories, I listened for stories. Listening for them is something more acute than listening to them. I suppose it's an early form of participation in what goes on. Listening children know stories are there. When their elders sit and begin, children are just waiting and hoping for one to come out, like a mouse from its hole.
An essential part of a happy, healthy life is being of service to others.
The brain may take advice, but not the heart, and love having no geography, knows no boundaries: weight and sink it deep, no matter, it will rise and find the surface.

To succeed, we must first believe that we can.
There is more learning in the question itself than the answer.
You will rise by lifting others.
In the end the aggressors always destroy themselves, making way for others who know how to cooperate and get along. Life is much less a competitive struggle for survival than a triumph of cooperation and creativity.
Time and money spent in helping people to do more for themselves is far better than mere giving.
Honor isn't about making the right choices. It's about dealing with the consequences.
Once you choose hope, anything is possible.

We are prone to judge success by the index of our salaries or the size of our automobiles, rather than by the quality of our service and relationship to humanity.
A man without a purpose is like a ship without a rudder.
Thinking is the hardest work there is, which is probably the reason why so few engage in it.
Learn to get in touch with the silence within yourself, and know that everything in life has purpose. There are no mistakes, no coincidences. All events are blessings given to us to learn from.
So many of our dreams at first seem impossible, then they seem improbable, and then when we summon the will, they soon become inevitable.

Permanence, perseverance and persistence in spite of all obstacles, discouragements, and impossibilities: It is this that in all things distinguishes the strong soul from the weak.
Failure is the opportunity to begin again more intelligently.
Caring about others, running the risk of feeling, and leaving an impact on people, brings happiness.
The most basic and powerful way to connect to another person is to listen. Just listen. Perhaps the most important thing we ever give each other is our attention...A loving silence often has far more power to heal and to connect than the most well-intentioned words.
Maybe the Fountain of Youth isn't a fountain at all. Maybe it's a way of looking at things. A way of thinking.
Believe, when you are most unhappy, that there is something for you to do in the world. So long as you can sweeten another's pain, life is not in vain.
A mystic bond of brotherhood makes all men one.
Whether you think that you can, or that you can't, you are usually right.
It's the most breathtakingly ironic things about living: the fact that we are all...alone. Singular. And yet what we seek -- what saves us -- is our connection to others.
We cannot really love anybody with whom we never laugh.
Friendship marks a life even more deeply than love. Love risks degenerating into obsession, friendship is never anything but sharing.
Condemn none: if you can stretch out a helping hand, do so. If you cannot, fold your hands, bless your brothers, and let them go their own way.
Our grand duty is not to see what lies dimly in the distance, but to do what lies clearly at hand.
Only connect.
I do not at all understand the mystery of grace -- only that it meets us where we are but does not leave us where it found us.
Humor brings insight and tolerance. Irony brings a deeper and less friendly understanding.
I don't believe in aging. I believe in forever altering one's aspect to the sun. Hence my optimism.
A laugh is a smile that bursts.

One must be fond of people and trust them if one is not to make a mess of life.
Promise yourself to be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own.
Depend upon yourself. Make your judgement trustworthy by trusting it. You can develop good judgement as you do the muscles of your body -- by judicious, daily exercise. To be known as a man of sound judgement will be much in your favor.
Pleasure is Nature's test, her sign of approval. When man is happy, he is in harmony with himself and his environment.
Humility does not mean thinking less of yourself than of other people, nor does it mean having a low opinion of your own gifts. It means freedom from thinking about yourself at all.
Most of the important things in the world have been accomplished by people who have kept on trying when there seemed to be no hope at all.
The fact is we can only love what we know personally. And we cannot know much. In public affairs, in the rebuilding of civilization, something less dramatic and emotional is needed, namely tolerance.
The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a person's determination.
They learn tolerance for others' faults through our tolerance of their own.
Ordinary riches can be stolen, real riches cannot. In your soul are infinitely precious things that cannot be taken from you.
It is well to remember that the entire population of the universe, with one trifling exception, is composed of others.

Love and respect are the most important aspects of parenting, and of all relationships.
The great virtue in life is real courage that knows how to face facts and live beyond them.
I beg you to have patience with everything unresolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves...Don't search for the answers, which could not be given to you now...the point is, to live everything. Live the questions now.
We can only be said to be alive in those moments when our hearts are conscious of our treasures.
What kills a skunk is the publicity it gives itself.
To me it seems that to give happiness is a far nobler goal that to attain it: and that what we exist for is much more a matter of relations to others than a matter of individual progress: much more a matter of helping others to heaven than of getting there ourselves.
Compassion is not sentiment but is making justice and doing works of mercy. Compassion is not a moral commandment but a flow and overflow of the fullest human and divine energies.
The only rule is, do what you really, impulsively, wish to do. But always act on your own responsibility, sincerely. And have the courage of your own strong emotion.
For one human being to love another: that is perhaps the most difficult of our tasks; the ultimate, the last test and proof, the work for which all other work is but preparation.

Too many people overvalue what they are not and undervalue what they are.
How far you go in life depends on you being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving and tolerant of the weak and the strong. Because someday in life you will have been all of these.
The whole art of teaching is only the art of awakening the natural curiosity of young minds for the purpose of satisfying it afterwards.
All men dream, but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds, wake in the day to find that it was vanity: but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act on their dreams with open eyes, to make them possible.

Blushing is the color of virtue.
You have to believe in yourself, that's the secret. Even when I was in the orphanage, when I was roaming the street trying to find enough to eat, even then I thought of myself as the greatest actor in the world. I had to feel the exuberance that comes from utter confidence in yourself. Without it, you go down to defeat.
How wonderful that no one need wait a single moment to improve the world.
As great scientists have said and as all children know, it is above all by the imagination that we achieve perception, and compassion, and hope.

Good words bring good feelings to the heart. Speak with kindness, always.
No one should be ashamed to admit they are wrong, which is but saying, in other words, that they are wiser today than they were yesterday.
We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness.

I will not die an unlived life. I will not live in fear of falling or catching fire. I choose to inhabit my days, to allow my living to open me, to make me less afraid, more accessible, to loosen my heart until it becomes a wing, a torch, a promise. I choose to risk my significance; to live so that which came to me as a seed goes to the next as a blossom and that which came to me as a blossom, goes on as fruit.

I've never been poor, only broke. Being poor is a frame of mind. Being broke is only a temporary situation.
When heaven is about to confer a great responsibility on any man, it will exercise his mind with suffering, subject his sinews and bones to hard work, expose his body to hunger, put him to poverty, place obstacles in the paths of his deeds, so as to stimulate his mind, harden his nature, and improve wherever he is incompetent.
Each person has an ideal, a hope, a dream which represents the soul. We must give to it the warmth of love, the light of understanding and the essence of encouragement.
Most people are like you and me, or the people across the street or around the world from you and me. Just like you and me, their hearts tell them that somewhere, somehow, they can make a positive difference in the world.

A programmer is a person who passes as an exacting expert on the basis of being able to turn out, after innumerable punching, an infinite series of incomprehensive answers calculated with micrometric precisions from vague assumptions based on debatable figures taken from inconclusive documents and carried out on instruments of problematical accuracy by persons of dubious reliability and questionable mentality for the avowed purpose of annoying and confounding a hopelessly defenseless department that was unfortunate enough to ask for the information in the first place.

But this has taken us far afield from interface, which is not a bad place to be, since I particularly want to move ahead to the kludge. Why do people have so much trouble understanding the kludge?

Calvin Coolidge looks as if he had been weaned on a pickle.
Contrariwise, continued Tweedledee, "if it was so, it might be; and if it were so, it would be; but as it isn't, it ain't. That's logic!"
Creation science has not entered the curriculum for a reason so simple and so basic that we often forget to mention it: because it is false, and because good teachers understand exactly why it is false. What could be more destructive of that most fragile yet most precious commodity in our entire intellectual heritage -- good teaching -- than a bill forcing honorable teachers to sully their sacred trust by granting equal treatment to a doctrine not only known to be false, but calculated to undermine any general understanding of science as an enterprise?
Deep is a word like "theory" or "semantic" -- it implies all sorts of marvelous things. It's one thing to be able to say "I've got a theory", quite another to say "I've got a semantic theory", but, ah, those who can claim "I've got a deep semantic theory", they are truly blessed.

The brain is a beautifully engineered get-out-of-the-way machine that constantly scans the environment for things out of whose way it should right now get. That's what brains did for several hundred million years -- and then, just a few million years ago, the mammalian brain learned a new trick: to predict the timing and location of dangers before they actually happened.
Our ability to duck that which is not yet coming is one of the brain's most stunning innovations, and we wouldn't have dental floss or 401(k) plans without it. But this innovation is in the early stages of development. The application that allows us to respond to visible baseballs is ancient and reliable, but the add-on utility that allows us to respond to threats that loom in an unseen future is still in beta testing.

... But if we laugh with derision, we will never understand. Human intellectual capacity has not altered for thousands of years so far as we can tell. If intelligent people invested intense energy in issues that now seem foolish to us, then the failure lies in our understanding of their world, not in their distorted perceptions. Even the standard example of ancient nonsense -- the debate about angels on pinheads -- makes sense once you realize that theologians were not discussing whether five or eighteen would fit, but whether a pin could house a finite or an infinite number.
... Fortunately, the responsibility for providing evidence is on the part of the person making the claim, not the critic. It is not the responsibility of UFO skeptics to prove that a UFO has never existed, nor is it the responsibility of paranormal-health-claims skeptics to prove that crystals or colored lights never healed anyone. The skeptic's role is to point out claims that are not adequately supported by acceptable evidence and to provide plausible alternative explanations that are more in keeping with the accepted body of scientific evidence. ...
... Had this been an actual emergency, we would have fled in terror, and you would not have been informed.
... The book is worth attention for only two reasons: (1) it attacks attempts to expose sham paranormal studies; and (2) it is very well and plausibly written and so rather harder to dismiss or refute by simple jeering.

Each honest calling, each walk of life, has its own elite, its own aristocracy based on excellence of performance.
Each team building another component has been using the most recent tested version of the integrated system as a test bed for debugging its piece. Their work will be set back by having that test bed change under them. Of course it must. But the changes need to be quantized. Then each user has periods of productive stability, interrupted by bursts of test-bed change. This seems to be much less disruptive than a constant rippling and trembling.

Every Horse has an Infinite Number of Legs (proof by intimidation):
Horses have an even number of legs. Behind they have two legs, and in front they have fore-legs. This makes six legs, which is certainly an odd number of legs for a horse. But the only number that is both even and odd is infinity. Therefore, horses have an infinite number of legs. Now to show this for the general case, suppose that somewhere, there is a horse that has a finite number of legs. But that is a horse of another color, and by the [above] lemma ["All horses are the same color"], that does not exist.

Every creature has within him the wild, uncontrollable urge to punt.
Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. This is not a way of life at all in any true sense.

Evolution is a bankrupt speculative philosophy, not a scientific fact.
Only a spiritually bankrupt society could ever believe it. ... Only atheists could accept this Satanic theory.

For the politicians this was never about how efficient they could make things happen or how to solve a problem, it is about the *appearance* of efficiency, or problem solving. My observation is that most politicians think more like sales people than technicians, and are about as clueful. Which means, unless the politicians change the way they think, discussion about how to use *them* to go about really solving these problems would be like asking a booth babe to write a kernel module.
For those who like this sort of thing, this is the sort of thing they like.

To manipulate or adjust, to tweak. Derived from FROBNITZ. Usually abbreviated to FROB. Thus one has the saying "to frob a frob". See TWEAK and TWIDDLE.
Usage: FROB, TWIDDLE, and TWEAK sometimes connote points along a continuum. FROB connotes aimless manipulation; TWIDDLE connotes gross manipulation, often a coarse search for a proper setting; TWEAK connotes fine-tuning. If someone is turning a knob on an oscilloscope, then if he's carefully adjusting it he is probably tweaking it; if he is just turning it but looking at the screen he is probably twiddling it; but if he's just doing it because turning a knob is fun, he's frobbing it.

I have found Christian dogma unintelligible. Early in life, I absented myself from Christian assemblies.
I have had interactions with developers who are convinced that everything in .Net was created solely by MS for open source usage. But that could be another result of vaccination preservatives.
I think all right-thinking people in this country are sick and tired of being told that ordinary, decent people are fed up in this country with being sick and tired. I'm certainly not! And I'm sick and tired of being told that I am.
I would defend the liberty of concenting adult creationists to practice whatever intellectual perversions they like in the privacy of their own homes; but it is also necessary to protect the young and innocent.
I would not dare to so dishonor my Creator God by attaching His name to that book [the Bible].
I'm also not very analytical. You know, I don't spend a lot of time thinking about myself, about why I do things.
I'm an evolutionist because I judge the evidence for the unity of life by common descent over billions of years to be overwhelming, not so that I can cheat on my wife or kick the cat with impunity. I live in no hope of heaven or fear of hell, but like most of my fellow Americans of all religious persuasions, I try to live a decent life. Folks like Tom DeLay just can't get it through their heads that a person can choose to live ethically because civilized life requires doing unto others as you would have them do unto you.
I am a member of a party of one, and I live in an age of fear. Nothing lately has unsettled my party and raised my fears so much as your editorial, on Thanksgiving Day, suggesting that employees should be required to state their beliefs in order to hold their jobs. The idea is inconsistent with our constitutional theory and has been stubbornly opposed by watchful men since the early days of the Republic.
November 29, 1947
I am always with myself, and it is I who am my tormenter.
I am astounded ... at the wonderful power you have developed -- and terrified at the thought that so much hideous and bad music may be put on record forever.
I am not now, and never have been, a girl friend of Henry Kissinger.
I am ready to meet my Maker. Whether my Maker is prepared for the great ordeal of meeting me is another matter.
I am the mother of all things, and all things should wear a sweater.
I am, in point of fact, a particularly haughty and exclusive person, of pre-Adamite ancestral descent. You will understand this when I tell you that I can trace my ancestry back to a protoplasmal primordial atomic globule. Consequently, my family pride is something inconceivable. I can't help it. I was born sneering.
I believe in getting into hot water; it keeps you clean.
I belong to no organized party. I am a Democrat.
I'll bet the human brain is a kludge.
I can call spirits from the vasty deep.
Why so can I, or so can any man; but will they come when you do call for them?
I can't complain, but sometimes I still do.
I cannot affirm God if I fail to affirm man. Therefore, I affirm both.
Without a belief in human unity I am hungry and incomplete. Human unity is the fulfillment of diversity. It is the harmony of opposites. It is a many-stranded texture, with color and depth.
I cannot and will not cut my conscience to fit this year's fashions.
I contend that we are both atheists. I just believe in one fewer god than you do. When you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours.
I could prove God statistically.
I didn't claw my way to the top of the food chain to eat veggies.
I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish Church, by the Roman Church, by the Greek Church, by the Turkish Church, by the Protestant Church, nor by any Church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.
I do not believe that this generation of Americans is willing to resign itself to going to bed each night by the light of a Communist moon...
I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them.
I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with sense, reason, and intellect has intended us to forgo their use.
I do not find in orthodox Christianity one redeeming feature.
I do not know myself, and God forbid that I should.
I do not mind what language an opera is sung in so long as it is a language I don't understand.
I don't believe in astrology. But then I'm an Aquarius, and Aquarians don't believe in astrology.
I don't care if I'm a lemming. I'm not going.
I don't care if it works on your machine! We are not shipping your machine!
I don't have any solution, but I certainly admire the problem.
I don't like spreading rumors, but what else can you do with them?
I dread success. To have succeeded is to have finished one's business on earth, like the male spider, who is killed by the female the moment he has succeeded in his courtship. I like a state of continual becoming, with a goal in front and not behind.
I dream of a better tomorrow, where chickens can cross the road and not be questioned about their motives.
I either want less corruption, or more chance to participate in it.
I fart in your general direction, tiny-brained wiper of other people's bottoms.
I generally avoid temptation unless I can't resist it.
I get the feeling that as soon as something appears in the paper, it ceases to be true.
I glance at the headlines just to kind of get a flavor for what's moving. I rarely read the stories, and get briefed by people who are probably read the news themselves.
I go to seek a great perhaps.
I had a great idea this morning but I did not like it.
I had a monumental idea this morning, but I didn't like it.
I hate quotations.
I have a simple philosophy:
Fill what's empty.
Empty what's full.
Scratch where it itches.
I have discovered the heart of bushido: to die!
I have never killed a man, but I have read many obituaries with great pleasure.
I haven't lost my mind -- it's backed up on tape somewhere.
I haven't lost my mind; I know exactly where I left it.
I judge a religion as being good or bad based on whether its adherents become better people as a result of practicing it.
I just thought of something funny...your mother.
I like a man who grins when he fights.
I like being single. I'm always there when I need me.
I like the future, I'm in it.
I maintain there is much more wonder in science than in pseudoscience. And in addition, to whatever measure this term has any meaning, science has the additional virtue, and it is not an inconsiderable one, of being true.
Vol. 12, Fall 87
I must have slipped a disk; my pack hurts.
I never fail to convince an audience that the best thing they could do was to go away.
I never met a piece of chocolate I didn't like.
I profoundly believe it takes a lot of practice to become a moral slob.
I program, therefore I am.
I put the shotgun in an Adidas bag and padded it out with four pairs of tennis socks, not my style at all, but that was what I was aiming for: If they think you're crude, go technical; if they think you're technical, go crude. I'm a very technical boy. So I decided to get as crude as possible. These days, though, you have to be pretty technical before you can even aspire to crudeness.
I regret to say that we of the F.B.I. are powerless to act in cases of oral-genital intimacy, unless it has in some way obstructed interstate commerce.
I regret to say that we of the FBI are powerless to act in cases of oral-genital intimacy, unless it has in some way obstructed interstate commerce.
I sat through it. Why shouldn't you?
I saw a werewolf drinking a pina colada at Trader Vic's.
I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,
Straining upon the start. The game's afoot.
I simply try to aid in letting the light of historical truth into that decaying mass of outworn thought which attaches the modern world to medieval conceptions of Christianity, and which still lingers among us -- a most serious barrier to religion and morals, and a menace to the whole normal evolution of society.
I support everyone's right to be an idiot. I may need it someday.
I think every good Christian ought to kick Falwell's ass.
I think Microsoft named .NET so it wouldn't show up in a Unix directory listing.
I think people are reacting to what they perceive to be your simplistic and fetishistic understanding of the economy, which is becoming more and more pronouncedly so in its outward manifestations as you react to your misunderstanding of people's reactions to your reaction to what you perceived as Sam's simplistic and fetishistic understanding of the economy.
I think that God in creating man somewhat overestimated his ability.
I think time is crucial to anything. For example, if you lock an infinite number of monkeys in a room with those typewriters, but you limit the amount of time they have to write, the best you'll get out of them is the pilot to The Dukes of Hazzard.
I think trash is the most important manifestation of culture we have in my lifetime.
I think we're all Bozos on this bus.
I think you ought to know I'm feeling very depressed.
I tried being reasonable once. I didn't like it.
I use not only all the brains I have but all that I can borrow.
I used to be indecisive; now I'm not sure.
I used to get high on life but lately I've built up a resistance.
I used to think I was indecisive, but now I'm not so sure.
I was brought up in the other service; but I knew from the first that the Devil was my natural master and captain and friend. I saw that he was in the right, and that the world cringed to his conqueror only from fear.
I was in this prematurely air conditioned supermarket and there were all these aisles and there were these bathing caps you could buy that had these kind of Fourth of July plumes on them that were red and yellow and blue and I wasn't tempted to buy one but I was reminded of the fact that I had been avoiding the beach.
I went on to test the program in every way I could devise. I strained it to expose its weaknesses. I ran it for high-mass stars and low-mass stars, for stars born exceedingly hot and those born relatively cold. I ran it assuming the superfluid currents beneath the crust to be absent -- not because I wanted to know the answer, but because I had developed an intuitive feel for the answer in this particular case. Finally I got a run in which the computer showed the pulsar's temperature to be less than absolute zero. I had found an error. I chased down the error and fixed it. Now I had improved the program to the point where it would not run at all.
I will never use biometrics. I'm afraid they'll make me change my password.
Few companies really work like the Borg. Most work a lot more like the Holy Roman Empire. News often takes weeks to travel from castle to castle by minstrel.
[The Ramones'] "I Wanna Be Sedated" should be played loud, poorly, and in some dingy club where you'd get grounded if your folks found out you were there, not quietly while strolling down the freezer aisle.
I will contend that conceptual integrity is *the* most important consideration in system design.
I wish there was a knob on the TV to turn up the intelligence. There's a knob called "brightness", but it doesn't work.
I wish they all could be California girls.
I wish you humans would leave me alone.
I would defend the liberty of consenting adult creationists to practice whatever intellectual perversions they like in the privacy of their own homes; but it is also necessary to protect the young and innocent.
I would have promised those terrorists a trip to Disneyland if it would have gotten the hostages released. I thank God they were satisfied with the missiles and we didn't have to go to that extreme.
I wouldn't mind dying -- it's that business of having to stay dead that scares the shit out of me.
I'll tell you what kind of guy I was. If you ordered a boxcar full of sons-of-bitches and opened the door and only found me inside, you could consider the order filled.
I'm a misanthrope. What's your fucking problem?
I'm growing older, but not up.
I'm in Pittsburgh. Why am I here?
I'm mad, and that's a fact./I found out animals don't help.
Animals think they're pretty smart./Shit on the ground, see in the dark.
I'm not breaking the rules. I'm just testing their elasticity.
I'm not expendable, I'm not stupid, and I'm not going.
I've got a bad feeling about this.
I've had fun before. This isn't it.
I've seen many politicians paralyzed in the legs as myself, but I've seen more of them who were paralyzed in the head.

If a President doesn't do it to his wife, he'll do it to his country.

If at first you don't succeed, redefine success.
If atheism is to be used to express the state of mind in which God is identified with the unknowable, and theology is pronounced to be a collection of meaningless words about unintelligible chimeras, then I have no doubt, and I think few people doubt, that atheists are as plentiful as blackberries...

If entropy is increasing, where is it coming from?
If everything is coming your way then you're in the wrong lane.

If someone gives you a lemon, make lemonade.
If someone had told me I would be Pope one day, I would have studied harder.
If someone were to ask me for a short cut to sensuality, I would suggest he go shopping for a used 427 Shelby-Cobra. But it is only fair to warn you that of the 300 guys who switched to them in 1966, only two went back to women.

This "cerebral spare tire" concept continues to nourish the clientele of "pop psychologists" and their many recycling self-improvement schemes. As a metaphor for the fact that few of us fully exploit our talents, who could deny it? As a refuge for occultists seeking a neural basis of the miraculous, it leaves much to be desired.

Consider all the people who sat home in a stew in 1968 rather than vote for Hubert Humphrey. They showed Humphrey.

Space is indifferent to what we do; it has no feeling, no design, no interest in whether or not we grapple with it. But we cannot be indifferent to space, because the grand, slow march of intelligence has brought us, in our generation, to a point from which we can explore and understand and utilize it. To turn back now would be to deny our history, our capabilities.
My past is my own.

Murphy was an optimist.
Objects on your screen are closer than they appear.
Obviously, a man's judgement cannot be better than the information on which he has based it. Give him the truth and he may still go wrong when he has the chance to be right, but give him no news or present him only with distorted and incomplete data, with ignorant, sloppy or biased reporting, with propaganda and deliberate falsehoods, and you destroy his whole reasoning processes, and make him something less than a man.

One millihelen: the unit of beauty required to launch just one ship
One of my less pleasant chores when I was young was to read the Bible from one end to the other. Reading the Bible straight through is at least 70 percent discipline, like learning Latin.

One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we've been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We're no longer interested in finding out the truth.

Write a recursive macro? Well, no, but Real Men use rescan. How could a language so obviously designed and written by Real Men not be intended for Real Man use?

This also simplifies modifying the program, should the value of pi change.

The reason ESP, for example, is not considered a viable topic in contemporary psychology is simply that its investigation has not proven fruitful...After more than 70 years of study, there still does not exist one example of an ESP phenomenon that is replicable under controlled conditions. This simple but basic scientific criterion has not been met despite dozens of studies conducted over many decades... It is for this reason alone that the topic is now of little interest to psychology... In short, there is no demonstrated phenomenon that needs explanation.

The tar pit of software engineering will continue to be sticky for a long time to come. One can expect the human race to continue attempting systems just within or just beyond our reach; and software systems are perhaps the most intricate and complex of man's handiworks. The management of this complex craft will demand our best use of new languages and systems, our best adaptation of proven engineering management methods, liberal doses of common sense, and ... humility to recognize our fallibility and limitations.

There were in this country two very large monopolies. The larger of the two had the following record: the Vietnam War, Watergate, double- digit inflation, fuel and energy shortages, bankrupt airlines, and the 8-cent postcard. The second was responsible for such things as the transistor, the solar cell, lasers, synthetic crystals, high fidelity stereo recording, sound motion pictures, radio astronomy, negative feedback, magnetic tape, magnetic "bubbles", electronic switching systems, microwave radio and TV relay systems, information theory, the first electrical digital computer, and the first communications satellite.

What is worth doing is worth delegating.
What is worth doing is worth the trouble of asking somebody to do.
What makes the Universe so hard to comprehend is that there's nothing to compare it with.
What publishers are looking for these days isn't radical feminism. It's corporate feminism -- a brand of feminism designed to sell books and magazines, three-piece suits, airline tickets, Scotch, cigarettes and, most important, corporate America's message, which runs: "Yes, women were discriminated against in the past, but that unfortunate mistake has been remedied; now every woman can attain wealth, prestige and power by dint of individual rather than collective effort."

When I was a boy I was told that anybody could become President. Now I'm beginning to believe it.
When I was in my twenties, not shaving for a few days gave me a cool Don Johnson/Miami Vice look. Now that I'm in my forties, though, it tends to make me look more like Otis from Mayberry.
When I was in school, I cheated on my metaphysics exam: I looked into the soul of the boy sitting next to me.
When you are in it up to your ears, keep your mouth shut.
When Yahweh your gods has settled you in the land you're about to occupy, and driven out many infidels before you...you're to cut them down and exterminate them. You're to make no compromise with them or show them any mercy.

When a fly lands on the ceiling, does it do a half roll or a half loop?
When a place gets crowded enough to require ID's, social collapse is not far away. It is time to go elsewhere. The best thing about space travel is that it made it possible to go elsewhere.
When a shepherd goes to kill a wolf, and takes his dog along to see the sport, he should take care to avoid mistakes. The dog has certain relationships to the wolf the shepherd may have forgotten.
When all other means of communication fail, try words.
When asked, "If you find so much that is unworthy of reverence in the United States, then why do you live here?" Mencken replied, "Why do men go to zoos?"

When we are ignorant of the answer to an important question, one way to proceed is to ask which path of inquiry promises best to facilitate learning.
When we are planning for posterity, we ought to remember that virtue is not hereditary.
When we jumped into Sicily, the units became separated, and I couldn't find anyone. Eventually I stumbled across two colonels, a major, three captains, two lieutenants, and one rifleman, and we secured the bridge. Never in the history of war have so few been led by so many.

Whether you can hear it or not The Universe is laughing behind your back
While Europe's eye is fix'd on mighty things,
The fate of empires and the fall of kings;
While quacks of State must each produce his plan,
And even children lisp the Rights of Man;
Amid this mighty fuss just let me mention,
The Rights of Woman merit some attention.

Writing code has a place in the human hierarchy worth somewhere above grave robbing and beneath managing.
Writing free verse is like playing tennis with the net down.
Writing in C or C++ is like running a chain saw with all the safety guards removed.
Writing programs needs genius to save the last order or the last millisecond. It is great fun, but it is a young man's game. You start it with great enthusiasm when you first start programming, but after ten years you get a bit bored with it, and then you turn to automatic-programming languages and use them because they enable you to get to the heart of the problem that you want to do, instead of having to concentrate on the mechanics of getting the program going as fast as you possibly can, which is really nothing more than doing a sort of crossword puzzle.
Xerox does it again and again and again and ...
Xerox never comes up with anything original.

Yes, we have no bonanzas.

You can't antagonize and influence at the same time.
You can't carve your way to success without cutting remarks.

You cannot build a reputation on what you are going to do.

You don't have to explain something you never said.
You don't have to think too hard when you talk to teachers.
You know, you really half give me a buzz.
You know why there are so few sophisticated computer terrorists in the United States? Because your hackers have so much mobility into the establishment. Here, there is no such mobility. If you have the slightest bit of intellectual integrity you cannot support the government.... That's why the best computer minds belong to the opposition.

[Leslie Stahl was] a pussy compared to Rather.
Grep me no patterns and I'll tell you no lines.
After all, all he did was string together a lot of old, well-known quotations.
All successful newspapers are ceaselessly querulous and bellicose. They never defend anyone or anything if they can help it; if the job is forced upon them, they tackle it by denouncing someone or something else.
A man who can laugh, if only at himself, is never really miserable.
College football is a game which would be much more interesting if the faculty played instead of the students, and even more interesting if the trustees played. There would be a great increase in broken arms, legs, and necks, and simultaneously an appreciable diminution in the loss to humanity.
Conscience is the inner voice which warns us that someone may be looking.
Democracy is also a form of worship. It is the worship of Jackals by Jackasses.
Every normal man must be tempted at times to spit on his hands, hoist the black flag, and begin slitting throats.
Faith may be defined briefly as an illogical belief in the occurrence of the improbable.
Explanations exist; they have existed for all time; there is always a well-known solution to every human problem -- neat, plausible, and wrong.
Equality before the law is probably forever inattainable. It is a noble ideal, but it can never be realized, for what men value in this world is not rights but privileges.
Faith may be defined briefly as an illogical belief in the occurrence of the improbable.
For one American husband who maintains a chorus girl in Levantine luxury around the corner, there are hundreds who are as true to their oaths, year in and year out, as so many convicts in the deathhouse.
I believe that religion, generally speaking, has been a curse to mankind -- that its modest and greatly overestimated services on the ethical side have been more than overborne by the damage it has done to clear and honest thinking.
I go on working for the same reason a hen goes on laying eggs.
Judge: a law student who marks his own examination papers.
Love is the triumph of imagination over intelligence.
Men have a much better time of it than women. For one thing, they marry later. For another thing, they die earlier.
My guess is that well over eighty per cent of the human race goes through life without ever having a single original thought. That is to say, they never think anything that has not been thought before, and by thousands. A society made up of individuals who were all capable of original thought would probably be unendurable. The pressure of ideas would simply drive it frantic.
Never let your inferiors do you a favor. It will be extremely costly.
No government is ever really in favor of so-called civil rights. It always tries to whittle them down. They are preserved under all governments, insofar as they survive at all, by special classes of fanatics, often highly dubious.
No one ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public.
Nowhere in the world is superiority more easily attained, or more eagerly admitted. The chief business of the nation, as a nation, is the setting up of heroes, mainly bogus.
Once he had one leg in the White House and the nation trembled under his roars. Now he is a tinpot pope in the Coca-Cola belt and a brother to the forlorn pastors who belabor halfwits in galvanized iron tabernacles behind the railroad yards.

Say what you will about the Ten Commandments, you must always come back to the pleasant fact that there are only ten of them.
Sin is a dangerous toy in the hands of the virtuous. It should be left to the congenitally sinful, who know when to play with it and when to let it alone.
Suppose two-thirds of the members of the national House of Representatives were dumped into the Washington garbage incinerator tomorrow, what would we lose to offset our gain of their salaries and the salaries of their parasites?
The capacity of human beings to bore one another seems to be vastly greater than that of any other animal.
The chief contribution of Protestantism to human thought is its massive proof that God is a bore.
The great artists of the world are never Puritans, and seldom even ordinarily respectable. No virtuous man -- that is, virtuous in the YMCA sense -- has ever painted a picture worth looking at, or written a symphony worth hearing, or a book worth reading, and it is highly improbable that the thing has ever been done by a virtuous woman.
The highfalutin aims of democracy, whether real or imaginary, are always assumed to be identical with its achievements. This, of course, is sheer hallucination. Not one of those aims, not even the aim of giving every adult a vote, has been realized. It has no more made men wise and free than Christianity has made them good.
The most costly of all follies is to believe passionately in the palpably not true. It is the chief occupation of mankind.
The notion that science does not concern itself with first causes -- that it leaves the field to theology or metaphysics, and confines itself to mere effects -- this notion has no support in the plain facts. If it could, science would explain the origin of life on earth at once -- and there is every reason to believe that it will do so on some not too remote tomorrow. To argue that gaps in knowledge which will confront the seeker must be filled, not by patient inquiry, but by intuition or revelation, is simply to give ignorance a gratuitous and preposterous dignity....
The one permanent emotion of the inferior man is fear -- fear of the unknown, the complex, the inexplicable. What he wants beyond everything else is safety.
The truth is that Christian theology, like every other theology, is not only opposed to the scientific spirit; it is also opposed to all other attempts at rational thinking. Not by accident does Genesis 3 make the father of knowledge a serpent -- slimy, sneaking and abominable. Since the earliest days the church as an organization has thrown itself violently against every effort to liberate the body and mind of man. It has been, at all times and everywhere, the habitual and incorrigible defender of bad governments, bad laws, bad social theories, bad institutions. It was, for centuries, an apologist for slavery, as it was the apologist for the divine right of kings.
There is, in fact, no reason to believe that any given natural phenomenon, however marvelous it may seem today, will remain forever inexplicable. Soon or late the laws governing the production of life itself will be discovered in the laboratory, and man may set up business as a creator on his own account. The thing, indeed, is not only conceivable; it is even highly probable.
To sum up:
1. The cosmos is a gigantic fly-wheel making 10,000 revolutions a minute.
2. Man is a sick fly taking a dizzy ride on it.
3. Religion is the theory that the wheel was designed and set spinning to give him the ride.
When women kiss it always reminds one of prize-fighters shaking hands.
When A annoys or injures B on the pretense of saving or improving X, A is a scoundrel.
Whenever you hear a man speak of his love for his country it is a sign that he expects to be paid for it.
From Fronto I learned to observe what envy, and duplicity, and hypocrisy are in a tyrant, and that generally those among us who are called Patricians are rather deficient in paternal affection.
The time of a man's life is as a point; the substance of it ever flowing, the sense obscure; and the whole composition of the body tending to corruption.
That [life] which is longest of duration, and that which is shortest, both come to one effect.
You must, therefore, hasten, not only because you are every day nearer to death, but also because your intellect, which enables you to know the true nature of things and to order all your actions by that knowledge, wastes and decays daily -- or, may fail you before you die.
Never esteem of anything as profitable, which shell ever constrain thee to break thy faith, or to lose thy modestroy; to hate any man, to suspect to curse, to dissemble, to lust after anything, that requireth the secret of walls or veils.
He who prefers, before all things, his rational part and spirit... he shall never lament and exclaim; never sigh; he shall never want either solitude or company; and, which is chiefest of all, he shall live without either desire or fear.
Let no act be done without a purpose, nor otherwise than according to the perfect principles of art.
Take away your opinion, and you then take away the complaint, "I have been harmed." Take away the complaint, "I have been harmed," and the harm is taken away.
Many grains of frankincense on the same altar: one falls before, another falls after; but it makes no difference.
Do not act as if you were going to live ten thousand years. Death hangs over you. While you live, while it is in your power, be good.
How much trouble he avoids who does not look to see what his neighbour says or does or thinks, but only to what he does himself, that it may be just and pure.
Everything which is in any way beautiful is beautiful in itself, and terminates in itself, not having praise as part of itself. Neither worse, then, nor better is a thing made by being praised.
The words which were formerly familiar are now antiquated: so also the names of those who were famed of old, are now in a manner antiquated... For all things soon pass away and become a mere tale, and complete oblivion soon buries them.
Everything is only for a day, both that which remembers and that which is remembered.
Thou art a little soul bearing about a corpse, as Epictetus used to say.
Time is like a river made up of the events which happen, and a violent stream; for as soon as a thing has been seen, it is carried away, and another comes in its place, and this will be carried away too.
Be like the promontory against which the waves continually break, but it stands firm and tames the fury of the water around it.
How easy it is to repel and to wipe away every impression which is troublesome or unsuitable, and immediately to be in all tranquility.
To seek what is impossible is madness: and it is impossible that the bad should not do something of this kind.
The best way of avenging yourself is not to become like the wrong-doer.
If any man is able to convince me and show me that I do not think or act right, I will gladly change; for I seek the truth by which no man was ever injured. But he is injured who abides in his error and ignorance.
Let not future things disturb you, for you will come to them, if it shall be necessary, having with you the same reason which you now use for present things.
Receive wealth or prosperity without arrogance; and be ready to let it go.
He often acts unjustly who does not do a certain thing; not only he who does a certain thing.
It is your duty to leave another man's wrongful act there, where it is.
America is a ball of Appalachia with a thin coating of civility.
American justice is measured by the amount of money you are willing to risk to make your point.
America has become a tired old whore, selling her institutions like back alley blowjobs to fat cat businessmen for their pocket change.
But in the end I remind myself that people are merely shaved apes, and pretty much spend their time masturbating and throwing feces.
I am waiting for the "Internet Beermeister," so hackers can wage a "Denial of Cerveza" attack.
Money doesn't stretch -- if somebody makes a killing, somebody else loses his shirt.
Never work anywhere where you can't find the guy in charge and break his nose.
Nothing is more dangerous than a man whose actions are the responsibility of his deity.
Some people hold their noses when used as toilet paper by the shadowy overlords; some people inhale the heady aroma with gusto.
Those who sacrifice liberty for the sake of safety deserve neither, but those who sacrifice creativity for safety end up with a velvet painting of Elvis.
Windows is a manifestation of commerce; Unix is a manifestation of culture.
Working in Windows is like baking moose shit pie. Sure, you're baking pies, but look what's in 'em.
I prefer the company of men without ovaries.
The American business executive resembles the Ferengi more each day. In another 20 years, there will be dorm rooms full of toothless hillbillies at the Amazon fulfillment centers and the Walmarts.
Be cautious of those who give you advice. That's my advice to you.
If you fail to plan, you plan to fail. Sounds like a plan.
If you take the easy way out, nothing will come easy.
By and large, language is a tool for concealing the truth.
Here's a bumper sticker I'd like to see: "We are the proud parents of a child whose self-esteem is sufficient that he doesn't need us promoting his minor scholastic achievements on the back of our car."
Honesty may be the best policy, but it's important to remember that apparently, by elimination, dishonesty is the second-best policy.
I have as much authority as the Pope, I just don't have as many people who believe it.
I'm completely in favor of the separation of Church and State. My idea is that these two institutions screw us up enough on their own, so both of them together is certain death.
I think it's the duty of the comedian to find out where the line is drawn and cross it deliberately.
If it's true that our species is alone in the universe, then I'd have to say the universe aimed rather low and settled for very little.
If God had intended us not to masturbate, he would've made our arms shorter.
If this is the best God can do, I'm not impressed.
Just because your tattoo has Chinese characters in it doesn't make you Spiritual. It's right above the crack of your butt. And it translates to "beef with broccoli." The last time you did anything spiritual, you were praying to God you weren't pregnant. You're not spiritual.
The very existence of flame-throwers proves that some time, somewhere, someone said to themselves, "You know, I want to set those people over there on fire, but I'm just not close enough to get the job done."
There are nights when the wolves are silent and only the moon howls.
Anybody who wants religion is welcome to it, as far as I'm concerned -- I support your right to enjoy it. However, I would appreciate it if you exhibited more respect for the rights of those people who do not wish to share your dogma, rapture or necrodestination.
Don't eat yellow snow.
Hey, you know something, people? I'm not black, but there's a whole lot of times I wish I could say I'm not white.
I never set out to be weird. It was always other people who called me weird.
I think pop music has done more for oral intercourse than anything else that has ever happened, and vice versa.
If you wind up with a boring, miserable life because you listened to your mother, your Dad, your priest, to some guy on television, to any of the people telling you how to do your shit, then you *deserve* it. If you want to be a schmuck, be a schmuck -- but don't wait around for respect from other people -- a schmuck is a schmuck.
In the future, etiquette will become more and more important. That doesn't mean knowing which fork to pick up -- I mean basic consideration for the rights of other animals (human beings included) and the willingness, whenever practical, to tolerate the other guy's idiosyncrasies.
Is that a real poncho? I mean, is that a Mexican poncho or a Sears poncho? Hmmm... No fooling.
Most people wouldn't know music if it came up and bit them on the ass.
Modern Americans behave as if intelligence were some sort of hideous deformity.
Most rock journalism is people who can't write interviewing people who can't talk for the people who can't read.
My best advice to anyone who wants to raise a happy, mentally healthy child is: Keep him or her as far away from a church as you can.
Remember, Information is not knowledge; Knowledge is not Wisdom;
Wisdom is not truth; Truth is not beauty; Beauty is not love;
Love is not music; Music is the best.
Remember, there's a big difference between kneeling down and bending over.
Take the Kama Sutra. How many people died from the Kama Sutra as opposed to the Bible? Who wins?
The bassoon is one of my favorite instruments. It has a medieval aroma, like the days when everything used to sound like that. Some people crave baseball...I find this unfathomable, but I can easily understand why a person could get excited about playing the bassoon.
The Book says BURN and DESTROY repent and redeem and revenge and deploy and rumble thee forth to the land of the unbelieving scum 'cause they don't go for what's in the Book and that makes 'em BAD.
The computer can't tell you the emotional story. It can give you the exact mathematical design, but what's missing is the eyebrows.
The essence of Christianity is told to us in the Garden of Eden history. The fruit that was forbidden was on the Tree of Knowledge. The subtext is,
All the suffering you have is because you wanted to find out what was going on. You could be in the Garden of Eden if you had just kept your fucking mouth shut and hadn't asked any questions.
There is more stupidity than hydrogen in the universe, and it has a longer shelf life.
There is no such thing as a dirty word. Nor is there a word so powerful, that it's going to send the listener to the lake of fire upon hearing it.
Our brains have just one scale, and we resize our experiences to fit.
There's no such thing as bad language. I don't believe that any more. That's ridiculous. They call it a "debasing of the language?" No! We are adults. These are the words that WE use, to express frustration, rage, anger -- in order that we don't pick up a tire iron and beat the shit out of someone.
I don't know if you noticed, but our two-party system is a bowl of shit looking in the mirror at itself.
There is a big difference between the Old Testament and the New Testament, and that is, the New Testament God is kind of a great guy (He is!), especially when you compare him to the Old Testament God, who is a prick.
The reason you should go to Las Vegas is because, for only the second time, the second time, ever, they have rebuilt Sodom and Gomorrah. It's back!! And you have the opportunity to see it before it turns to salt. And you wanna get out there before the Christian Right finds out what we're up to and shits all over it.
[The Weather Channel] is the most watched cable channel in America. I'll repeat that. It is the most watched cable channel in America. They were worried about the terrorists immobilizing us, and a portion of our countrymen watch weather. 'Kay, you don't get any more immobile than that... unless you're in a goddamn coma. That means you're saying, "I'd go to the window, but it's too far." If you want to know what the weather is you go to a window and stick your hand out and if you want to know what the temperature is you drive by a bank.
There's no such thing as soy milk. It's soy juice. But they couldn't sell soy juice, so they called it soy milk. Because anytime you say soy juice, you actually... start to gag.
You don't want another Enron? Here's the law:
If you have a company, and it can't explain, in one sentence... what it does... it's illegal!
The one thing I think we learned this year is that the Democrats and the Republicans are completely worthless.
If mzero doesn't need to be a single, unambiguous value, then the algebra of monads would seem to be a bit hinky.
A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors, what's the problem?
Real knowledge is to know the extent of one's ignorance.
Rotten wood cannot be carved.
Men's natures are alike. It is their habits that carry them far apart.
Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in getting up every time we do.
It does not matter how slowly you go so long as you do not stop.
We like to think we spend most of our time power-typing. "I'm being productive, I'm writing programs!" But, we don't. We spend most of our time looking into the abyss, saying, "My God, what have I done?"
That hardly ever happens is another way of saying, "It happens".
I used to think everyone should learn programming. When I first starting programming...I thought, "Wow, this is such an amazing way to organize information! Everybody should learn to do this!" I don't think that any more. I think there has to be something seriously wrong with you, in order to do this work. A normal person, once they've looked into the abyss, will say, "I'm done. This is stupid. I'm going to go to something else." But not us, 'cause there's something really wrong with us.
Confusion must be avoided. Confusion is the enemy. Confusion is what causes bugs and security mishaps and all the other things that make us miserable.

Geriatric Relativity: The observation that time goes faster the older you get.
Critical thinking is the antidote to gullibility and credulity, which explains why politicians aren't fond of critical thinking.
The president of the United States has claimed, on more than one occasion, to be in dialogue with God. If he said that he was talking to God through his hairdryer, this would precipitate a national emergency. I fail to see how the addition of a hairdryer makes the claim more ridiculous or offensive.
Man is manifestly not the measure of all things. This universe is shot through with mystery. The very fact of its being, and of our own, is a mystery absolute, and the only miracle worthy of the name.
What is so unnerving about the candidacy of Sarah Palin is the degree to which she represents -- and her supporters celebrate -- the joyful marriage of confidence and ignorance . . . Ask yourself: how has "elitism" become a bad word in American politics? There is simply no other walk of life in which extraordinary talent and rigorous training are denigrated. We want elite pilots to fly our planes, elite troops to undertake our most critical missions, elite athletes to represent us in competition and elite scientists to devote the most productive years of their lives to curing our diseases. And yet, when it comes time to vest people with even greater responsibilities, we consider it a virtue to shun any and all standards of excellence. When it comes to choosing the people whose thoughts and actions will decide the fates of millions, then we suddenly want someone just like us, someone fit to have a beer with, someone down-to-earth -- in fact, almost anyone, provided that he or she doesn't seem too intelligent or well educated.
Unreason is now ascendant in the United States -- in our schools, in our courts, and in each branch of the federal government.
The point at which we fully acquire our humanity, and our capacity to suffer, remains an open question, but anyone who would dogmatically insist that these traits must arise coincident with the moment of conception has nothing to contribute, apart from his ignorance, to this debate.
Water is two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen. This seems as value-free an utterance as human beings ever make. But what do we do when someone doubts the truth of this proposition? Ok, all we can do is appeal to scientific values. The value of understanding the world. The value of evidence. The value of logical consistency. What if someone says, "Well, that’s not how I choose to think about water." Ok, what can we say to such a person? Ok, all we can do is appeal to scientific values. And if he doesn’t share those values, the conversation is over. Ok, if someone doesn’t value evidence, what evidence are you going to provide to prove that they should value it? If someone doesn’t value logic, what logical argument could you provide to show the importance of logic?
I love living in the future.

If, after hearing my songs, just one human being is inspired to say something nasty to a friend, or perhaps to strike a loved one, it will all have been worth the while.
I'm not tempted to write a song about George W. Bush. I couldn't figure out what sort of song I would write. That's the problem: I don't want to satirise George Bush and his puppeteers, I want to vaporize them.
I basically like "comments," though they can seem a little jarring: spit- flecked rants that are appended to a product that at least tries for a measure of objectivity and dignity. It's as though when you order a sirloin steak, it comes with a side of maggots.
I disagree with those who suggest that we permanently close down the U.S. mail on the grounds that it can kill you. That is sheer hysteria. I think we should permanently close down the U.S. mail on the grounds that it has been making us sick for quite a while.
Anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job.
Bypasses are devices that allow some people to dash from point A to point B very fast while other people dash from point B to point A very fast. People living at point C, being a point directly in between, are often given to wonder what's so great about point A that so many people from point B are so keen to get there and what's so great about point B that so many people from point A are so keen to get THERE. They often wish that people would just once and for all work out where the hell they wanted to be.
Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the Western Spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-eight million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue-green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea ...
Men were real men, women were real women, and small, furry creatures from Alpha Centauri were REAL small, furry creatures from Alpha Centauri. Spirits were brave, men boldly split infinitives that no man had split before. Thus was the Empire forged.
Space is big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind- bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist's, but that's just peanuts to space.
The word "spine" is, of course, an anagram of "penis". This is true in almost fifty percent of the languages of the Galaxy, and many people have attempted to explain why. Usually these explanations get bogged down in silly puns about "standing erect".
There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is another theory which states that this has already happened.
With a rubber duck, one's never alone.
Inspiration usually comes during work, rather than before it.
That's the way things come clear. All of a sudden. And then you realize how obvious they've been all along.
When we were children, we used to think that when we were grown-up we would no longer be vulnerable. But to grow up is to accept vulnerability... To be alive is to be vulnerable.

These people live again in print as intensely as when their images were captured on old dry plates of sixty years ago... I am walking in their alleys, standing in their rooms and sheds and workshops, looking in and out of their windows. Any they in turn seem to be aware of me.
When I'm ready to make a photograph, I think I quite obviously see in my minds eye something that is not literally there in the true meaning of the word. I'm interested in something which is built up from within, rather than just extracted from without. -- Ansel Adams When in doubt, tell the truth.

We’ve bought into the idea that education is about training and "success", defined monetarily, rather than learning to think critically and to challenge. We should not forget that the true purpose of education is to make minds, not careers. A culture that does not grasp the vital interplay between morality and power, which mistakes management techniques for wisdom, which fails to understand that the measure of a civilization is its compassion, not its speed or ability to consume, condemns itself to death.
Inverted totalitarianism, unlike classical totalitarianism, does not revolve around a demagogue or charismatic leader. It finds expression in the anonymity of the Corporate State. It purports to cherish democracy, patriotism, and the Constitution while manipulating internal levers.
Washington has become our Versailles. We are ruled, entertained, and informed by courtiers -- and the media has evolved into a class of courtiers. The Democrats, like the Republicans, are mostly courtiers. Our pundits and experts, at least those with prominent public platforms, are courtiers. We are captivated by the hollow stagecraft of political theater as we are ruthlessly stripped of power. It is smoke and mirrors, tricks and con games, and the purpose behind it is deception.
The split in America, rather than simply economic, is between those who embrace reason, who function in the real world of cause and effect, and those who, numbed by isolation and despair, now seek meaning in a mythical world of intuition, a world that is no longer reality-based, a world of magic.
Hope has a cost. Hope is not comfortable or easy. Hope requires personal risk. It is not about the right attitude. Hope is not about peace of mind. Hope is action. Hope is doing something. The more futile, the more useless, the more irrelevant and incomprehensible an act of rebellion is, the vaster and more potent hope becomes. Hope never makes sense. Hope is weak, unorganized and absurd. Hope, which is always nonviolent, exposes in its powerlessness, the lies, fraud and coercion employed by the state. Hope knows that an injustice visited on our neighbor is an injustice visited on all of us. Hope posits that people are drawn to the good by the good. This is the secret of hope's power. Hope demands for others what we demand for ourselves. Hope does not separate us from them. Hope sees in our enemy our own face.
Racism towards Muslims is as evil as anti-Semitism, but try to express this simple truth on a partisan Palestinian or Israeli website.
